Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday  December 21  2000  Page E01 Kaiser Aluminum Corp  had planned to spend December making aluminum at its giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest  run by electricity from the Bonneville Power Administration s Columbia River dams  Then it saw a better deal  With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting unheard of peaks  Kaiser shut down its two U S  smelters last week  It is selling the electricity it no longer needs    for about 20 times what it pays Bonneville under long standing contracts  It is a measure of this winter s fuel crunch  Some big industrial firms in energy intensive sectors such as paper  fertilizers  metals and even oil field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or natural gas than manufacturing their products  The shifts by such large industrial consumers of energy    described as unprecedented by analysts    will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter  But they also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year  Shortages of aluminum and fertilizer  for example  are likely to give another upward jolt to consumer prices and further weaken the economy  analysts said   The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don t know what they re going to use to grow crops with   said David Wyss  chief economist at Standard   Poor s  Some economists have recently increased their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter s heating bills on an already weakening economy  Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than  1 000 for a typical U S  household  That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers  20 billion in higher energy costs compared with a year ago  they estimated  cutting the expected growth in the nation s economic output by one percentage point on an annual rate in the first three months of next year   Overall  the recent energy price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic slowdown   the Goldman Sachs report concluded  Terra Industries Inc   in Sioux City  Iowa  has closed three of its six U S  ammonia plants  which use natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production  Like Kaiser  the company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices  which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its existing December supply contract  said Mark Rosenbury  chief administrative officer   We looked at these  current  prices and said   This is crazy     he said  Terra hasn t disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas  but Rosenbury said it would be  substantial    In coming months  Terra s good fortune could be reversed  It usually buys gas a month at a time  and the prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break even point  That would keep Terra s plants closed  Rosenbury said  but eliminate the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit   If this persists   Rosenbury said   it s going to be a real problem   He estimates that out of a total annual U S  production capacity of 18 million tons of ammonia  about 4 million tons of production isn t operating now   Could we be short of fertilizer next spring  It s possible that farmers will not have as much as they want   Rosenbury said  Royster Clark Inc   a Norfolk and New York City based fertilizer manufacturer and distributor  has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque  Ill   indefinitely  and 72 production workers will be laid off  beginning next month  The story is the same    natural gas prices are too high to justify continued production   We believe it s likely this is a speculative bubble  in natural gas prices  that will burst and in a few weeks we ll be able to buy gas at a more reasonable price  but that remains to be seen   said Paul M  Murphy  the company s managing director for financial planning  A continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers  decisions to plant feed corn  he said   It s sticker shock   According to Wyss  if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas remains above  7 per million cubic feet    double the level a year ago    farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002  In the aluminum industry  several smaller producers have joined Kaiser  the industry s No  2 manufacturer  in closing down  noted Lloyd O Carroll  an analyst with BB T Capital Markets in Richmond  Aluminum production in November was 8 3 percent below that of November 1999  and December s production will be lower still  he said   We ll get more production cut announcements  I think   he said  A slowing in the U S  and world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum supplies   But if the world economy doesn t fall completely apart  then  aluminum  prices are going to rise  and they could rise significantly more than the current forecast   he said  In Kaiser s case  it s an open question how much of its electric windfall it will keep  Kaiser is contractually entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at  22 50 a megawatt per hour  says spokesman Scott Lamb  That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville for  550 a megawatt hour for December  But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut down plants  to invest in new electric generating capacity  or even to refund to Bonneville s other customers  said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey  Kaiser and Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after next October  but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits   Out here  a deal is a deal  but it has to be a moral deal  There has to be an ethical dimension to this and we re not shy in trying to make sure they live up their advantage in having access to this publicly owned power   Mosey said

Times Page 4  Column 6 c  2001 New York Times Company  WASHINGTON    IN the forensic pursuit of what caused California s power  failure  the Bush administration  the energy industry and many analysts have  granted immunity to deregulation   Robert Shapiro  a managing director of Enron  the giant electricity marketer   says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other  states    because California didn t really deregulate    Spencer Abraham  the  new energy secretary  said Californians simply goofed  setting up a    dysfunctional   system  It is the way California deregulated  not  deregulation itself  that should take the blame  they say  Yet some economists argue that California s troubles should inform the debate  about whether    not just how    to deregulate  Among them is Alfred E  Kahn   the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free  markets in the rail  trucking and airline industries     I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets    Mr  Kahn said   He is still studying whether the design flaws in California s market explain  the whole problem  But he is sounding a note of skepticism     I ve always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration    he  said  referring to the old ways of allowing a single  heavily regulated power  company to produce  transmit and distribute electricity    It may be one  industry in which it works reasonably well     Mr  Kahn s comments might sound a little heretical  When this former Carter  administration official was pushing deregulation  it was still a novel and  politically risky concept  Today  getting government out of most businesses  is part of the Washington economic canon   Moreover  few people believe that California  the first state to overhaul its  electricity sector from top to bottom  has proved a good laboratory  To  satisfy interest groups  the markets were designed in an awkward way  which  soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went  on the auction block   Among the quirks  The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power  on daily spot markets  rather than arranging long term contracts that might  have allowed them to hedge risk  Consumer prices were also fixed  making it  impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs   Paul L  Joskow  an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr  Kahn s  remains hopeful  that the kinks can be ironed out   In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states  as well in as Britain   Chile and Argentina  all places that have restructured electricity markets   regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws  They have found  ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and  charge high prices  Mr  Joskow said   Regulators have also had to establish new markets that  through price  signals  encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so  that they have reserves for peak hours  During peak hours  shortages and  price spikes can substantially raise average prices     If they can do it in Britain  Chile and Argentina  then I think we can do  it here    Mr  Joskow said   Still  he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices   Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one  Making sure  Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another     The political system must rise to the task    Mr  Joskow said  or the   old  way might be the best we can do     Mr  Kahn knows a bit about the old way  In the mid 1970 s  he headed the New  York Public Service Commission  which oversaw electricity and other regulated  industries  The drawbacks were legendary  Local utilities had an endemic  tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants  for which  consumers paid through steady rate increases  Nearly everyone assumed that  competition would slash prices   But though free markets do a better job managing rail  phone and airline  prices  they have yet to match regulators  ability to juggle the complexities  of electricity  Mr  Kahn said   Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep  prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin  The vertical  integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages  Mr  Kahn  said  Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal  ways  Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them  to be built    The players all depended on one another    he said   California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts  But it has made  people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for  widgets   Photo  Alfred E  Kahn   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved      National Desk 3 Executives Considered to Head

NEWS Enron s Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain   Critics regard Kenneth Lay as  deregulation opportunist David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer  03 04 2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A1  Copyright 2001   Kenneth Lay is one of the energy  pirates  accused by California s governor  of fleecing consumers  As chairman of Enron Corp   the world s largest energy  trader  Lay is arguably the biggest  baddest buccaneer of them all   But that s not how he wants to be seen  And he certainly doesn t like taking  knocks from Gov  Gray Davis for having contributed to California s energy  mess   It s very unfair   Lay said  his brown eyes taking on a puppy  dog quality    He s trying to vilify us  But we didn t make the rules in California  We had  nothing to do with creating the problem    He gazed out from his plush  50th floor office  Houston s downtown  skyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky    Everyone played by the rules   Lay said   Now our reputations are being  maligned    In a sense  he s right  The ultimate blame does rest with California  policymakers for deregulating the state s electricity market in such a  ham fisted way that power giants like Enron cleaned up by exploiting  loopholes in the system   But Enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process    Enron and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for  deregulation in California   said Janee Briesemeister  senior policy analyst  in the Austin office of Consumers Union   A lot of what s happening in  California was their idea    Those familiar with the state s deregulation efforts said Enron was  especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange  where  wholesale power would be bought and sold  was separate from the Independent  System Operator  which would oversee the electricity grid    This fragmented the wholesale market  making it harder to monitor   said  John Rozsa  an aide to state Sen  Steve Peace  D El Cajon  widely regarded as  the godfather of California s bungled deregulation measures    Enron isn t in the business of making markets work   Rozsa said   They re in  the business of making a buck    In an ironic twist  however  Enron now could play a pivotal role in helping  the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing  The company has  that much clout   SEEKING LAY S BLESSING  Thus  as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission  lines of California s cash strapped utilities  he didn t hesitate to call  recently seeking Lay s personal blessing for the plan   This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had  been castigated by Davis in the governor s State of the State speech    I told him we couldn t support it   Lay said  a hint of a smile playing  across his lips   It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid  and  longer term  it could make things worse    Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with Enron s big cheese   Simple  Davis will need the Bush administration s backing to make the  power line sale fly  and  many believe  there s no faster way to reach the  new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron   Lay  58  and his company have donated more than  500 000 to Bush s various  political campaigns in recent years  and he placed Enron s private jet at  Bush s disposal during the presidential race   So great is Lay s influence with the president that some insist he is now  serving effectively as shadow energy secretary  shaping U S  energy policy as  he sees fit    There s a long history of Enron pulling the levers of its political  relationships to get what it wants   said Craig McDonald  director of Texans  for Public Justice  a watchdog group   What Ken Lay thinks energy policy  should be isn t very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it  should be    ANOTHER VIEWPOINT  Lay  of course  sees things differently  At the mere mention of his close  rapport with the president  his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited  the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months    I have known the president and his family for many years   Lay said   I ve  been a strong supporter of his  I believe in him and I believe in his  policies    He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are   grossly exaggerated    Still  it is striking that Bush s quick decision after taking office to limit  federal assistance in solving California s energy woes virtually mirrored  Lay s own thoughts on the situation  So  too  with the administration s  hands off approach to resolving the crisis   Whatever else  California s power woes have been very kind to Enron s bottom  line  The company s revenues more than doubled to  101 billion last year   They haven t hurt Lay  either  According to company records  his pay package  more than tripled last year to  18 3 million   Lay and other Enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the company s  California earnings from other worldwide business activities  But Lay  conceded that Enron s profit from California energy deals last year was  not  inconsequential     We benefit from the volatility   he said   CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE  That s putting it mildly  It could be said that California s energy mess was  tailor made for Enron  which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a  captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are  simultaneously soaring skyward   To understand why that is  one must look closely at Enron s complex business  model  The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy  deals   Lay  with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy  regulator  set about completely reinventing Enron in 1985 after taking over  what was then an unexceptional natural gas pipeline operator   As he saw it  the real action was not in distribution or generation of  energy  but in transacting lightning fast deals wherever electricity or gas  is needed    treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time   Enron is now the leader in this fast growing field  and uses that advantage  to consolidate its position as the market maker of choice for energy buyers  and sellers throughout the country   It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually  creative deals  For example  if electricity prices are down but natural gas  prices up  Enron might cut a deal to meet a utility s power needs in return  for taking possession of the gas required to run the utility s plants   Enron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere  using part of the  proceeds to purchase low priced electricity from another provider  which it  ships back to the original utility    We do best in competitive markets   Lay said   These are sustainable  markets    TRADING FRENZY  Enron s trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly  young  mostly male employees scan banks of flat panel displays in search of  the best deals  Rock music blares from speakers  giving the scene an almost  frat party atmosphere   The company s trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an  Internet based bidding system  which logged 548 000 trades valued at  336  billion  making Enron by far the world s single biggest e commerce entity   Kevin Presto  who oversees Enron s East Coast power trades  called up the  California electricity market on his computer  With a few quick mouse clicks   he showed that Enron at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at   250 per megawatt hour and selling it at  275    Some days we re at  250  some days  300 and some days  500   Presto said  over the steady thump thump of the trading floor s rock  n  roll soundtrack    There s truly a problem out there    This is a recurring theme among Enron officials  California s electricity  market is broken and Enron would prefer it if things just settled down  As  Lay himself put it   The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace    In reality  California s dysfunctional marketplace means Enron isn t just  making piles of money  it s seeing profits both coming and going   LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA  The company s energy services division  which handles the complete energy  needs of large institutions  counts among its clients the University of  California and California State school systems  Oakland s Clorox Co   and  even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park   Enron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and  Electric Co   which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market  values  At the same time  Enron sells power to PG E at sky high wholesale  levels   In other words  Enron is buying back its own electricity from PG E for just a  fraction of the price it charges the utility    These guys are the pariahs of the power system   said Nettie Hoge  executive  director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco   Why do we need  middlemen  They don t do anything except mark up the cost    To be fair  energy marketers such as Enron can help stabilize an efficient  marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers   This has proven the case in Pennsylvania  where Enron actively trades among  about 200 market participants   But in an inefficient market such as California  a company like Enron can  easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the state s ill conceived  regulatory framework   Sylvester Turner  a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state  committee that oversees Texas utilities  said he can t blame Enron and other  power companies for pursuing profits in California    California set up some bad rules  and these companies played by the rules  California set up   he said   At the end of the day  they will behave to  enhance their bottom lines    But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next  year  Turner said he has learned from California s experience    and is  taking steps to prevent Texas  power giants from shaking down local  consumers   LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE  He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission  more authority in cracking down on market abuses  The power companies are  fighting the legislation as hard as they can   Not least among Turner s worries is that Texas will see what California  officials believe happened in their state  A deliberate withholding of power  by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher    I have that concern   he said   I don t necessarily take these companies at  their word    For his part  Lay insists that Enron has never deliberately manipulated  electricity prices    I don t know of any of that   he said   It s so easy to conjure up  conspiracy theories    As a sign of Enron s commitment to solving California s energy troubles  Lay  said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating long term power  contracts on behalf of utilities   So how many contracts has Enron signed   Suddenly  the hurt  puppyish expression vanished from Lay s face  and a  harder  more steely look glinted from his eyes    None   he said   We won t be signing until we re certain about recovering  our costs    Consider this a shot across California s bow   PHOTO  Caption  Chairman Kenneth Lay said Enron had  nothing to do with  creating the  energy  problem     Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All

AP    Yes  his business has profited handsomely from  California s energy crisis  but Enron Corp  Chairman Kenneth Lay says he  shouldn t be a scapegoat in California s energy crisis   That hasn t swayed Gov  Gray Davis  who has skewered energy companies such as  Houston based Enron for selling expensive power to California   Never again can we allow out of state profiteers to hold Californians  hostage   Davis warned in his State of the State address   More recently  however  Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the state  looks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities    I told him we couldn t support it   Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in  an interview at his Houston office   It will lead to an even less efficient  transmission grid and  longer term  it could make things worse    Lay is not just any private sector energy czar   Enron Corp  is the world s  largest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush  Lay  and his corporation have donated more than  500 000 to Bush s various  political campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of Enron s  private jet during the presidential race   But Lay said it s economics  not politics  that matter in California s energy  crisis  And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed out of state energy  brokers for the protracted problems    We didn t make the rules in California   Lay said   We had nothing to do  with creating the problem    The problem  many analysts agree  began with the state s deregulation of the  power industry in 1996  Enron encouraged deregulation  and the state s  ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation   Enron s stock jumped 86 percent in 2000 and its revenues more than doubled to   101 billion  Lay  58  was compensated accordingly   he received nearly  16  million in stock and cash beyond his  1 3 million salary last year  compared  with less than  4 million in bonuses in 1999   Lay refused to say how much Enron has made off California s crisis  though he  conceded the profit was  not inconsequential     We benefit from the volatility   said Lay  who took over Enron in 1985 and  has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of  electricity as a commodity   But Lay rejected suggestions that Enron has manipulated prices upward by  insisting California pay dearly for last minute power that has helped keep  the lights on in recent months    I don t know of any of that   he said   It s so easy to conjure up  conspiracy theories    Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved     BUSINESS NET WORTH The Stadium Curse    Some stocks swoon after arena deals Kathleen Pender  03 04 2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL B1  Copyright 2001   Is buying the name of a big league stadium the kiss of death for a company   or does it only seem that way   From Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland to the unfinished CMGI Field  outside Boston  the nation is dotted with sports venues named after companies  whose stocks have been sacked  The Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens play in a stadium named after  PSINet  whose stock has fallen 92 percent to  1 25 a share since it bought  naming rights   The problem names are not all tech   The owners of the TWA Dome in St  Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are  looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt   TWA is an airline  Pro Player was part of underwear maker Fruit of the Loom   The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if  Edison International  parent of electric utility Southern California Edison   runs out of juice   Of course  these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens  or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a  ballpark or arena   In fact  many were at their peak   Which begs the question  Should investors get worried when a company in which  they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights   Brian Pears  head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management  wonders if  companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the  Sports Illustrated  curse   It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI  magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle   Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon  Amazon com Chief  Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazine s 1999 person of the  year just before his company s stock price tanked   Don Hinchey  who advises buyers and sellers in naming rights deals  doesn t  think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals    You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming  rights sponsorship  but you can t necessarily say it corresponds with a peak  in its business   says Hinchey  director of creative services for the Bonham  Group in Denver   TRACKING NAMING FIRMS  To find out if Hinchey is right  I tracked the stock market performance of  publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to 47 big league  sports venues in North America   I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies  including  Miller Park in Milwaukee  Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris  and Pac  Bell Park in San Francisco  Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications   which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio    I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals  are  after all  marketing endeavors  The announcement of a deal generates  tons of publicity  which is considered positive  even if the publicity is  negative and even if the stadium won t open for several years   Then I compared each company s stock market performance with the Standard    Poor s 500 index during the same period   The bottom line  29 of the 47 companies that bought stadium or arena names  are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced   according to data from FactSet Research Systems   Two companies each bought  two names and were counted twice    But    and this is a big but    only 13 of them beat the S P 500 during the  period since their respective deals were announced   So buying a stadium name might not be a curse  but it s no guarantee the  company will beat the market   WINNERS  LOSERS  The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide  variety of industries   The biggest winner is Qualcomm  a wireless telecommunications company   Although its stock is down 65 percent from its peak  it s still up 746  percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium   The next biggest winners include Target  discount stores   Ericsson  telecom  equipment   Coors  beer   Fleet Financial  banking   Pepsi  soft drinks  and  Enron  energy    The biggest losers are TWA  PSINet  Internet service provider   CMGI   Internet incubator   Savvis Communications  telecom services  and Network  Associates  network security software    Network Associates  stock peaked about three months after it bought naming  rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September 1998  Since then  it has suffered  a string of setbacks  After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned  its accounting practices  it restated its financial results for 1997 and  1998  Its CEO resigned in December   Network Associates is paying slightly more than  1 million per year for the  coliseum name  It can get out of its 10 year deal after five years   The company  has been paying us   says Deena McClain  general counsel with  the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum Authority   We haven t had any  discussions with them  about changing the contract   Most naming rights contracts have  out clauses that allow the parties to  extricate themselves if they want  can or need to in the event of financial  difficulties or if a team moves   says Hinchey   Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser  stadium owners may  benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early   That s because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid  1990s   when  1 million a year    give or take    was average   In 1999  FedEx agreed to pay  205 million over 27 years to be named home of  the Washington Redskins   In 2000  CMGI agreed to pay  114 million over 15 years to have its name on  the new home of the New England Patriots  It s questionable what kind of  shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year   The  10 gallon hat of naming rights deals   says Hinchey  is in Houston   where Reliant Energy will pay  300 million over 32 years to name the  Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself   Some customers of Reliant s utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal  was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates   Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a  stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends   But Jim Grinstead  editor of Revenues from Sports Venues  says   you have to  look at the  stadium  purchase in light of total marketing budget  It sounds  like big money  but frequently it s over 20 to 30 years  If you take out  things the company might buy anyway  like tickets and luxury suites  it s  small potatoes    WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH  The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game  is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print    This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding   says Jennifer  Keavney  a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal   She says the cost of her deal  about  1 million a year   won t even buy you a  Super Bowl ad  It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised  football game  maybe    The Coliseum  perched beside Interstate 880  also acts like a giant billboard  for the company  which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports   Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes  on site  exposure through signage and kiosks  premium nights when the sponsor might  offer samples at the park  and inclusion in programs  tickets and flyers   Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name  because they sell consumer products or services   But not always   3Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to  Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1995    It was a good move for them   says Jim Grinstead  editor of Revenues from  Sports Venues   They got the employees they were looking for  the visibility  they were looking for  At the time  they were a player in a crowded field   and they wanted to look like a fun place to work    Last April  3Com extended its original 4 year contract for two more years   The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility  will be a loser    Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand  their sales and  hospitality efforts  Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not  performing well   Hinchey says   But corporations realize the team s success  on the field fluctuates  It could be a champion one year  next year in the  dumps    The same can be said about the corporate sponsors  which is something stadium  owners    be they taxpayers or business tycoons    must realize when they  sell a name

000711 tx el paso 2 html  Tuesday July 11  5 42 pm Eastern Time Company Press Release SOURCE  El Paso Energy Corporation El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share HOUSTON  July 11  PRNewswire     El Paso Energy Corporation  NYSE  EPG  http   finance yahoo com q s epg d t    news   n e epg html   today announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of  0 69  an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings per share of  0 40  The second quarter 2000 results exclude  0 13 per share of one time merger related items  Diluted average common shares outstanding for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million  Consolidated adjusted earnings before interest expense and income taxes  EBIT  for the second quarter increased by 55 percent to  408 million  compared with  263 million in the year ago period  EBIT from the company s non regulated businesses more than tripled in the quarter to  246 million  and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT    Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in our other non regulated segments produced these record results    said William A  Wise  president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy Corporation    Reflecting our long standing strategy of building a portfolio of flexible gas and power assets  Merchant Energy s earnings continued to accelerate in the second quarter    For the first six months of 2000  adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 84 percent to  1 40 per share  compared with  0 76 for the first six months of 1999  Consolidated EBIT for the six months  excluding non recurring items  increased 55 percent to  798 million compared with  515 million in the year ago period  Second Quarter Business Segment Results The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of  152 million in the second quarter 2000  compared with  6 million in the same period last year and  50 million in the first quarter 2000  The physical and financial gas and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating significant value in the current volatile energy environment  Enhanced trading opportunities around our asset positions  continued strong wholesale customer business  and management fees from Project Electron  the company s off balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments  all contributed to the record second quarter performance  The Production segment reported a 30 percent increase in second quarter EBIT to  52 million compared with  40 million a year ago  reflecting higher realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the reorganization of its business in 1999  Weighted average realized prices for the quarter were  2 26 per million cubic feet  MMcf  of natural gas and  19 21 per barrel of oil  up 12 percent and 29 percent  respectively  from the year ago levels  Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day and oil production averaged 14 275 barrels per day  The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of  30 million  nearly double an adjusted  16 million in 1999  The increase was due primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins  together with the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March 2000  Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4 1 trillion Btu per day  TBtu d   while processing volumes averaged 1 1 TBtu d  Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record  the Natural Gas Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of  190 million compared with an adjusted  187 million a year ago  reflecting the realization of cost savings from the Sonat merger  Overall system throughput averaged 11 3 TBtu d  During the quarter  Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement filed in March  The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of  12 million compared with  16 million in 1999  Higher equity income from projects in Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company s investment in the Philippines  Telecom Update   We have made substantial progress in the development of our telecommunications business  El Paso Global Networks    said William A  Wise    Reflecting our market centric approach to developing new businesses  we have named Greg G  Jenkins  the current president of El Paso Merchant Energy  to head our telecommunications business  Our expertise in building businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets  as demonstrated by our Merchant Energy success  provides us with a key competitive entry point in the telecommunications marketplace    Quarterly Dividend The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of  0 206 per share on the company s outstanding common stock  The dividend will be payable October 2  2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 1  2000  There were 237 786 853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled to receive dividends as of June 30  2000  With over  19 billion in assets  El Paso Energy Corporation provides

cicumstances    From  David Forster ENRON enronXgate on 05 08 2001 09 55 AM To  John Arnold HOU ECT ECT cc  Savita Puthigai ENRON enronXgate  Subject     John   You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more  intelligence for out of hours trading than just leaving the products on Last  Trade is Mid   Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work  It builds on  Offset to Last Trade functionality   The simplified description is  It tracks two variables  Intensity Speed  and  Bias  Buy or Sell emphasis    As Intensity increases  the Spread increases   As Bias increases  the Offset increases   I ll call later to see what you think of the idea   Dave     Program Criteria  The formula which defines the trading decision making program will need to  work with several criteria inputs definitions  These might be   Intensity  Speed    The average time between transaction attempts  regardless  of whether they are buys or sells  Measured as a moving average over the last   Intensity Factor  transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction  Tibco messages for the Product  Obviously  the lower the Intensity calculation  the higher the transaction  flow  Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow  Intensity Factor   The number of transactions to be included in the moving  average Intensity calculation  A possible value for this might be  4    Buys   The number of Buys which have occurred   Sells   The number of Sells which have occured  Transaction Count   Could be either  Buys or  Sells  whichever last occured    Buy Offset   The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs  Sell Offset   The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs  Offset Reversion Ratio  ORR   The amount by which the Buy Offset should be  reduced if a Sell occurs  or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy  occurs   A possible value for this might be  0 3   If the application of the  ORR results in a reduction of less than 1  then the reduction shall be 1  Transaction Reversion Ratio  TRR   The amount by which  Buys should be  reduced if a Sell occurs  or amount  Sells should be reduced if a Buy  occurs   A possible value for this might be  0 3   If the application of the  TRR results in a reduction of less than 1  then the reduction shall be equal  to 1  Spread Minimum   The minimum Spread value allowed  A possible value for this  might be  0 04  Spread Maximum   The maximum Spread value allowed  A possible value for this  might be  0 50  Offset Minimum   The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells  A  possible value for this might be  0   Offset Maximum  The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells  A  possible value for this might be  0 50  Initial Offset   The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started Initial Spread   The Spread used when the program is started Spread Offset Minimum   The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed  Offset  Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer  A  possible value for this might be  0 01  Dead Interval   The period of time which must pass before the program will  recalculate the above Criteria  if no transactions have taken place during  the Dead Interval  A possible value for this might be  240  seconds   Program Outputs  The program should output the following variables as a result of combining  the above Criteria in a user defined Formula   Spread  integer    as per current Stack Manager Offset  integer    as per current Stack Manager Suspension  boolean    Whether or not the Product should be suspended   Normally  False    Program Interface and Operation Principles  The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a  relationship among the above Criteria  which will produce and apply the  Outputs to a particular Product  This relationship would be defined with  Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas    Every time a Transaction occurs  or a Dead Interval passes  the Criteria will  be recalculated and the user defined formulas will be reviewed by the  program  If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place   then Intensity   Intensity  240 and  Buys  Buys TRR and  Sells  Sells TRR and  Buy Offset   Buy Offset  ORR and Sell Offset   Sell Offset   ORR    If the user defined Formulas  see following  indicate that a change in spread  should occur  then if the Offset is zero  in the case of a trade occurring   or if no trade has occured  during the passing of a Dead Interval   the  system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last  transaction  adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread  value   Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread Offset Minimum  If a  reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread Offset Minimum  then the  Buy Offset  or Sell Offset  or both as appropriate  shall be reduced  accordingly  Similarly  if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula  to a level greater than the Spread  the Spread shall be increased to maintain  the Spread Offset Minimum   GUI Formulas Example   Constants Intensity Factor   4  Dead Interval   240  Offset Reversion Ratio  ORR    0 3  Transaction Reversion Ratio  TRR    0 3  Spread Minimum  0 04  Spread Maximum  0 50  Offset Minimum  0  Offset Maximum  0 49  Spread Offset Minimum  0 01

Transactions would be  Buys or  Sells  as appropriate  Note also  that  Buys and  Sells are not intended to be an absolute count  but rather  are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently  occured   In this example  all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through  the GUI    Simulation  Obviously  if we want to proceed  we will want to conduct several simulations  to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness  However  to give some idea of  how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular  direction  please see the attached      Additional Features  System Notifications  There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader  which will be  similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks  Warning and Failure levels for both  Offset and Price  The warning levels will trigger a pager message  The  Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be  automatically suspended  The Price checks will be against prices input by the  trader  not relative price movements  but actual price   There should be both  maximum and minimum price checks  e g  gas is trading at  5 50  The  notification levels could be  8 at the top end and  2 at the bottom end    Offset checks will only be against a maximum value      Dave   '

history for this week  last week  or next week by 15 bcf   seems a  little far fetched to me   Our analysis is saying  gas at 2 50 we would have  had 4 5 bcf a day more demand   that includes commercial residential  industrial switching processing        as far as 2 bcf d  power gen demand  that counts the fact that last year was  extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year  west will be  running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe  5  still and hydro way down   every molecule that can will flow west from  waha this summer versus little last year   east power prices really havent  reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where  gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand   some concern of  more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify   we re trying to build  the stack now to estimate    frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors   will  continue coming back   a little concerned about 2 oil prices   bordering  right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise  100 000 last week as gas got to parity    let me look into inj capability   definitely bigger when field is empty from  engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen  demand low and inj capacity lower   my initial thoughts  bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now   really  inactive  to clarify  not raging bull   i like everybody want to see what the inj  numbers in april look like   nobody putting a position on until that starts  to clarify   just think that hedging demand is making market a little short  right now making next move up more likely   would be scale up seller though not really sure why cash trades at 10 15 back   doesnt make any sense    however as more fields start turning around throughout month  the stg arb to  great in my opinion to keep spread there   must close one way or the other    notice that spread tightened to 6 8 towards end of trading friday  in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here   50  cents lower and no switching  no processing  and gain back some demand    market needs to see some big stg numbers first     i think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads    Jan 4 3 5 look great to me   if we get back to 2 8 and don t match last  year s early weather  bombs away         slafontaine globalp com on 03 03 2001 07 03 14 AM To  jarnold enron com cc    Subject  friday    this doesnt allow for new generation demand which is unclear cuz it requires power px  also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient  weather of course  but 2bcf d sounds hi esp shudnt happen until loads peak in july shud be marginal in apr jun    if you notice im not alot diff than your guys 4 6 demand destruction is implied but im including a factor for R C energy conservation ie poor guys  like me turning lites off and thermostat down its making a difference  that will be less factor in shoulder demand months reason why i think y on y s d swing will be closer to 5 bcf apr jun  if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think we ll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner      now rember the 7 4 is vs gas at sub 6 00 ie february which is approx  where we are today     all that being said yes some demand has come back but it is as i consider extraordinary demand destruction those things which never really have occured before like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins ie liquids  which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel  some ammonia fert prod  has come back as well  but when you get down to 2  3 bcf d industrial in the more i think of it may not be destruction anymore as mucha unction of an economic slowdown      anyway  i think i only know two guys that are bearish me and one of your  big fund customers ospraie   we ll see   is collins bullish as well he seems  quieter in the mkt lately    heres another one what you guys think the industry capacity for injection is on a weekly basis  we sud test it   in other words if the max is say 105 then means the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi and be unable to inject all the gas available  thots     also  you any idea why cash at the

  Please read the following problem very carefully  and write in a number at the end   You should be ready to defend your answer   Only a number is allowed  not an algebraic equation   Acquiring a Company       In the following exercise you will represent Company A  the acquirer   which is currently considering acquiring Company T  the target  by means of a tender offer   You plan to tender in cash for 100  of Company T s shares but are unsure how high a price to offer   The main complication is this  the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking   Indeed  the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome   If the project fails  the company under current management will be worth nothing   0 share   But if the project succeeds  the value of the company under current management could be as high as  100 share   All share values between  0 and  100 are considered equally likely   By all estimates  the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management  In fact  whatever the ultimate value under current management  the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T   If the project fails  the company is worth  0 share under either management   If the exploration project generates a  50 share value under current management  the value under Company A is  75 share   Similarly  a  100 share value under Company T implies a  150 share value under Company A  and so on        The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company T s shares   This offer must be made now  before the outcome of the drilling project is known   From all indications  Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A  provided it is at a profitable price   Moreover  Company T wishes to avoid  at all cost  the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm   You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in  then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press        Thus  you  Company A  will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer  but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer   In addition  Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the  per share  value of the company under current management   Thus  if you offer  50 share  for instance  Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than  50        As the representative of Company A  you are deliberating over price offers in the range of  0 share  this is tantamount to making no offer at all  to  150 share   What price offer per share would you tender for Company T s stock                per share                           '

Hold it  Hold it  O K   now breathe out   Unless you re outdoors in the midst of a cold snap  chances are you can t see your breath  And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin box for the right to free this invisible spirit from your lungs  Yet last November  Murphy Oil Corp   based in El Dorado  Ark   voluntarily shelled out several hundred thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide  the same stuff you exhaled three sentences ago   The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that same autumn day  half a world away  at the Hague  Thousands of policymakers and scientists from all over the world had gathered  hoping to dot the i s  cross the zeds and umlaut the o s on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the U N  Framework Convention on Climate Change  The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission of six gases  CO2 among them  that are slowly  actually quickly in geological terms  turning the earth into a hothouse  But no final accord was reached   In this context  Murphy s purchase of options on 210 000 metric tons of carbon  the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27 800 cars  from a Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target seems a bit odd  The market for this kind of trade hasn t been established  and there isn t even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued  Indeed there isn t even unanimity on global warming itself   Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an environmental transition  Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord  and global bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon emissions trading system  But corporations  against the run of play  are beginning to confront the climate conundrum the best way they know how  as a business opportunity  John Browne  CEO of BP Amoco  and Mark Moody Stuart  chairman of Royal Dutch Shell Group  have both responded to the global warming threat and set up internal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto  Shell and BP have vowed to cut their greenhouse gas emissions 10  each  nearly twice the Kyoto target  Shell by 2002  BP by 2010   This isn t an act of altruism   says Aidan Murphy of Shell   It s a fundamental strategic issue for our business    And not theirs alone  A growing number of corporations  from IBM to your neighborhood Kinko s  are reducing their greenhouse footprints  DuPont is pledging to knock its emissions 65  below 1990 levels by 2010   There s been a shift in the center of gravity in the U S  corporate community since Kyoto   says Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists   Now the view is that climate change is serious and we ought to do something about it    There are a few ways of doing that  invest in renewable energy sources and  cap and trade  emissions  That is  set ceilings for worldwide greenhouse gas emission and let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their allowance or buy credits if they exceed permitted levels  The theory is that the pursuit of greenbacks will fuel greener business   Whenever you turn a pollution cut into a financial asset   says Joseph Goffman  an attorney at Environmental Defense   people go out and make lots of pollution cuts    Even where green fervor is of a paler shade  corporations are viewing the potential for global regulation as a business risk they need to consider  Witness Claiborne Deming  Murphy s CEO  who doesn t see the science of global warming as solid enough yet to cry havoc  But Deming hears shareholders clamoring and the bureaucrats buzzing  Someone may ask his company to put more than a quarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allotted amount of CO2   Breathe in  Hold it  You know the drill   How much CO2 did you just exhale  Tricky question  Yet that s analogous to the one businesses are struggling with on a massive scale  Until they figure it out  companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine 1  how you buy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and 2  how to do so when no nation currently assigns a CO2 property right   It s risky as hell   says Deming   Many groups are working to mitigate that risk  The World Resources Institute and others are road testing a system that would make trading less risky by creating universal carbon accounting practices  And four companies  Arthur Andersen  Credit Lyonnais  Natsource and Swiss Re  are developing an exchange where companies can trade  even in an embryonic market devoid of legislative standards   They re trying to nail down something that will be useful under laws that are not yet defined   says Garth Edward  a broker at Natsource  an energy trading firm   The U S  struggled to introduce a cap and trade system into the Kyoto Protocol  and achieved it by agreeing to a tough  many say impossible  target  bringing emissions 7  below 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012  The irony of the current situation is that the Europeans  reluctant to accept trading at first  have become its champion  Britain next month will become the first country to embark on a national trading system   Another practice  still hotly debated  is to assign credits for sequestering carbon in growing forests  Trees soak up limited amounts of CO2  release oxygen into the air and turn carbon into wood   The Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification  thus setting up an early environmental test for President Bush  who campaigned against the document  But Secretary of State Colin Powell has already heard preliminary briefings on the matter as the U S  preps for the next round of talks  to be held in Bonn in mid July  Bush the First helped pioneer credit trading in 1990  when he signed legislation that capped power plants  sulfur dioxide emissions  the main ingredient in acid rain  but allowed the plants to swap credits  And Houston based Enron  an energy trader whose chairman  Ken Lay  was a prominent W  campaign adviser  stands to be a huge player in any such market  So if it s good for business  Bush the ex businessman won t need that big a push   With him or without him  the monetization of carbon emissions  green for greed s sake  if nothing else  is gaining momentum  So breathe easy  For you  it s still free  But for many companies  the carbon meter will be running soon  In the very near future  pollution is going to be either a cost to them or an opportunity     '

a share price that has plunged by more than half in two   weeks  as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business  20 Puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year  in

20 But some are keeping a wary eye on the company s finances and credit status   after a downgrade by one of the major rating agencies   We certainly are very well aware of what our exposure is to them and watch  ing that on a daily basis   Chief Executive Marce Fuller of Atlanta energy   marketer Mirant Corp  told Reuters  20  At this point  I would categorize it as pretty much as business as

CRUMBLES 20 Analysts say that if confidence in Enron continued to crumble  it could res  trict the company s access to credit and thus create problems for its core   energy trading operations  20 European energy industry sources told Reuters earlier on Monday that there   was already evidence of European companies shying away from trading with En  ron because of credit worries  20 Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron in Europe   as they hold urgent talks with the U S  group about setting up new credit   arrangements  the sources said  20  They are talking with us about bank letters of credit   said the head of r  isk management at one U K  utility that halted its trade with Enron last we  ek   The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very res  trictive basis   20 Traders in the U S  wholesale energy markets said on Monday that they were   continuing to deal with Enron and still regard the company as a reliable tr  ading partner  20  I don t have any problems dealing with Enron  especially since I m doing d  ay ahead trades  But I have heard the rumors of people not wanting to deal   with them   one natural gas trader in the U

placed the Houston based company s   P 2   rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade        Moody s may downgrade Enron s commercial paper rating  which would make it harder for the firm to borrow the short term cash needed to run its trading businesses  Ahead of a potential cut  Enron took out bank lines to repay  2 billion in commercial paper last week  largely removing itself from

deterioration in Enron s financial flexibility   since the write downs and charges  The partnership investments had not been disclosed before this month  which   led to a substantial loss in investor confidence    according to Moody s          A credit downgrade will be punitive as far as their borrowing power    said Joe Correnti  who follows Enron for Wayne Hummer Investments LLC in Chicago

 Adds yield data in fourth paragraph  adds Moody s comments in sixth and seventh paragraphs         New York  Oct  29  Bloomberg     Enron Corp  s credit rating was cut by Moody s Investors Service after the largest energy trader wrote down the value of its assets because of losses from private partnerships        Moody s also said it may downgrade Enron s commercial paper rating  which could make it harder for the company to borrow the short term cash it needs to run its trading business in the future  The company borrowed from banks to repay  2 billion in commercial paper last week

said the cut was prompted by the   deterioration in Enron s financial flexibility   since the write downs and charges  The partnership investments had not been disclosed before        Enron s recent

Showing Their Faith 20 By Jonathan Moreland   mailto jonathan insiderinsights com   Special to TheStreet com 10 29 2001 03 30 PM EST URL    http   www thestreet com comment moreland 10003164 html    Name an industry where one of its best known players went public in 1996  s  aw its stock rise more than 1 800  in the following five years  but now fin  ds its shares half off their 2001 highs  Internet  Telecom equipment  20 Surprise  The stock is Calpine  CPN NYSE   news   commentary    and the ind  ustry is electric utilities  20 Three other stocks in the same group have given investors pretty wild rides   as well  only to find themselves well off their 52 week highs  AES  AES NY  SE   news   commentary    Mirant  MIR NYSE   news   commentary  and NRG Ene  rgy  NRG NYSE   news   commentary    20 These four companies also have something else in common  Insiders at all of   them are signaling that their stocks are oversold  When there is significa  nt insider buying in so many related firms  we cannot help but think there   is a positive industry trend to profit from  20 Utilities may not seem like a sexy sector  but these particular stocks have   proved that they can move as well as any small cap  high tech play  Their   volatility stems from the fact that the companies they represent are not re  gulated utilities paying fat dividends  but independent power producers  IP  Ps  that derive as much profit as they can from the margins over fuel costs    20 In some ways  IPPs are to regulated utilities what the old English navy was   to the Spanish Armada  IPPs are less restricted in the scope and geography   of their business movements  This has spurred a more entrepreneurial cultu  re at IPPs that often allows them to outmaneuver regulated utilities when c  hasing after business opportunities  20 The insider buying at all four companies was obviously interesting  They al  l had several insiders recently purchasing within a short time period  and   many of the buyers also had good track records trading their companies  sha  res  Several were also adding significantly to their holdings  20 At AES  for example  three of the eight executives that purchased shares in   late September for  13 a share or less  were also smart sellers over the p  ast few years when AES fetched between  40 to  60  And at Mirant  the five   insiders that purchased in September increased their holdings by an average   of 53   20 This confluence of positive insider signals was more than enough to get me   researching these companies and this industry further  and I like what I se  e  20  There s been a lot of talk about if we have an oversupply of energy   rema  rks Calpine spokesperson Katherine Potter on one of the main reasons IPP st  ocks are weak now   But while supply may be fine right now  you also have t  o look at the quality of  that  supply  There is such a tremendous opportun  ity to replace infrastructure   20 Out With the Old  In With the New The fact is  there are a lot of antiquated power plants and overburdened ba  ckbones in the power industry  and IPPs stand to benefit tremendously from   replacing the older infrastructure to service the growing demand for energy   in the U S  and abroad  20 With more scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of the present  aging facil  ities exacerbating price spikes  municipalities and industry would much rat  her choose reasonably priced energy from dependable sources if they are ava  ilable  20 Although most IPPs use oil  gas  coal or a combination of these fuels to po  wer present facilities  the vast majority of plants they re building now ar  e a new generation of natural gas powered turbines that are much more effic  ient than old gas fired facilities  An IPP will typically build one of thes  e new plants near cities or other areas with high and growing electricity n  eeds  and compete with the older facilities in the region for the business    20 But it s not really fair competition  New plants can generate up to 40  mor  e energy from the same amount of gas used by some older designs  The new na  tural gas turbines also have a smaller footprint and fewer emissions than t  heir predecessors  and can therefore be located closer to where the power i  s needed  Can you say lower transmission costs  20 So with the cost of the natural gas representing a good two thirds of a gen  erator s cost  less fuel expenditure combined with a decrease in transmissi  on infrastructure to pay for leaves more love left for an IPP s bottom line    20 As older gas fired and nuclear plants are decommissioned  IPPs will continu  e to increase the amount of product  and profits  they produce  At the same   time  the trend toward more efficient gas plants will help slow the increa  ses in overall demand for natural gas  and keep the cost of this commodity   from reaching stratospheric levels  20 Although  as previously mentioned  IPP stocks are well off their highs  ana  lysts are as taken with the group as insiders are right now  Most analysts   following the four IPPs I ve recommended rate them a buy or strong buy  20 This is not too surprising considering that bottom line growth for NRG  AES    and Calpine next year is forecast at 24  to 25   while analysts expect Mi  rant to boost earnings per share by 30  in 2002  All of these shares are tr  ading for 12 times or less the low end of next year s EPS expectations  20 Chartists will note that the technicals of the IPP stocks I ve mentioned st  ill look weak  and may choose to wait for a better entry point  But longer   term investors should feel comfortable joining the insiders now  20 Postscript Readers will note that we have not included Enron  ENE NYSE   news   commen  tary  in our group of recommended IPPs  Although we cannot boast of foresee  ing its present travails  resulting from too clever by half off balance she  et investments   we had ignored it because Enron did not have a positive in  sider signal like its peers  20 Insiders were still selling Enron as late as Aug  2 of this year when the s  tock was nearly half off its highs  and although there was one insider purc  hase in August  there was not a cluster of activity as in the other IPP sto  cks we ve recommended  There was no buying after Sept  11  20 If Enron s problems are unique to it  as the industry insiders we talked to   believe  this is yet another case of insiders giving investors an excellen  t signal of relative attractiveness of stocks within an industry  20   A Debacle Like Enron

 The rating agency said it would review the Pri  me 2 rating on Enron s commercial paper  Last Thursday  Enron announced it had tapped its lines of credit to provide   more than  1 billion in cash liquidity and that would it use  2 billion to   pay down commercial paper  The decision to pay off the commercial paper  he said  accomplishes two goa  ls   It increases liquidity on a short term

this morning that it is in talks with banks for addit  ional credit  as declining investor confidence sent its stock to a six year   low and several large energy groups put their dealings with Enron on hold    Last Thursday  the energy trader drew down about  3 billion from a credit   line  causing its bonds to fall sharply on Friday  20  Enron  nyse  ENE   has been scrambling to reassure investors and business p  artners since Oct  16  after the company reported its first quarterly loss   in more than four years  The  638 million loss included  1 01 billion in ch  arges on ill fated investments  A week later  it disclosed that the U S  Se  curities and Exchange Commission had asked for information on partnerships   run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives  Fastow w  as forced to step down from the company last week  20  The turmoil makes it clearer than ever that Enron s problems weren t solved   by the recent departure of Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling    In these challenging times  Enron deserves our thanks 20 Houston Chronicle  October 28  2001 By BILL WHITE 20 Enron and its employees have blessed Houston  and many Houstonians should n  ow take the time to say  thanks  when the company has experienced some high  ly publicized challenges  Enron attracted thousands of great people to Hous  ton and changed Houston s economy forever  The company s management encoura  ged their employees to be active citizens  and those folks responded by mak  ing a big difference in their community  20 Enron s lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a   multibillion dollar new industry  with Houston as its hub  Even while it c  ompeted hard to win in the marketplace  Enron s example helped show other n  atural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger mark  et of electricity  The downtown concentration of these firms    industry le  aders including Reliant  Dynegy  El Paso and Duke Energy    led London s Fi  nancial Times to refer to Louisiana Street as the Wall Street of electricit  y  20 This explosive growth attracted bright young people    with the average age   of Enron employees at under 35    and they in turn helped fuel an explosio  n in residential growth in Houston s downtown  This  in turn  helped revita  lize downtown s retail and restaurant scene  Enron s construction of a larg  e Class A office tower  still going up  is a milestone in Houston s growth    an official end to more than a decade of large amounts of vacant office sp  ace  20 Virtually every civic or charitable activity in Houston learned to count on   Enron for both financial support and thousands of hours of invaluable volu  nteer activities  If Enron or its chairman  Ken Lay  led a visionary effort    such as hosting the meeting of G7 trade ministers  or more recently the p  rivate funding of the Houston Biotechnology Center  Houstonians knew it wou  ld be done right  Without Lay our town would have lost major league basebal  l and status as a big league town  20 Employees know Enron set a standard for hiring and promoting employees base  d on their potential  with no glass ceilings  Women have run large division  s and subsidiaries  Many military officers find that Enron called on their   talents after illustrious military careers  even at ages well past normal c  orporate entry level  The most highly recruited young people flock to a com  pany that invests heavily in their training and then lets them rise as far   and fast as their talent and ability to work hard would allow them  20 Enron s corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees   who have lived the American dream  With the habits of work learned on a fam  ily farm in Missouri  Ken Lay got an education ending with a graduate degre  e at the University of Houston  served his country in government and began   a career in the gas pipeline business  When Northern Natural Gas acquired t  he smaller Houston Natural Gas  Northern s chairman surprised folks by inst  alling Lay as his successor  I was at Northern s headquarters in Omaha the   week after the merger 16 years ago when Northern s chairman reassured folks   that they could count on  best young executive in the business  Ken Lay     to direct their future in a changing marketplace  Within 15 years  most of   Enron s revenues and profits came from businesses that did not even exist w  hen Lay had taken over  all of which had been created from within the firm    This success did not diminish the farm boy decency and sense of fairness t  hat attracted top talent to his team  20 Enron rewarded innovation  while many firms afraid to alter the old formula   wondered why their leadership eroded  Year after year  top executives thro  ughout the country voted Enron our nation s most innovative corporation  En  ron recognized  even when financial markets do not  that innovative firms a  re secure enough to accept occasional failure and the inevitable price of o  ther successes  20 Rather than seeking insulation from the international marketplace  as had m  any American businesses  Enron welcomed the challenge of the international   market  confident that American firms could compete and win  Enron also wel  comed the challenge of responsible environmental stewardship  and called on   industry to address the issue of global warming even as some companies fea  red the impact of pollution control on their bottom line  20 Enron s phenomenal success created incredible and perhaps unreasonable expe  ctations  as early this year when the stock market valued the company based   on 20 percent annual growth  forever  Enron s size and success made it a c  onvenient target for politicians in California and India  even as Enron sup  plied the electricity they so needed  Sometimes it seemed the company s ups  tart origins as the David battling utility Goliaths delayed the firm s perc  eption that it had won and no longer played the role of an underdog  20 And so if Enron experiences problems  it will learn from them  just as stro  ng people do  Let s not prejudge Enron s current challenges  The more than   a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies wh  o hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but ne  ver to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story    20 Throughout its years of success  Enron folks have never forgotten to find s  o many ways to make the firm s hometown of Houston a better place to live a  nd work  As Enron enters a new phase of its life  let s not forget to expre  ss thanks and steady support  20  White is a Houston business executive and civic leader and former governmen  t

25 01       Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative 2001 10 25 13 49  New York   Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative  Fitch NY October 25  2001  Fitch places the following Enron securities on Rating Watch Negative  senior unsecured debt  BBB    subordinated debt  BBB   preferred stock  BBB    and commercial paper  F2   Pipeline subsidiary  A   rated senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co  and Transwestern Pipeline Co   are also placed on Rating Watch Negative   The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital market reaction to recent disclosures by the company  The loss of investor and counterparty confidence  if it continues  would impair Enron s financial flexibility and access to capital markets  therefore  impacting its ability to conduct its business  On Oct  16  2001  Enron announced a  1 billion after tax charge to earnings to be taken in the third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet equity by  1 2 billion relating to the unwinding of structured transactions  Since that time  there have been several damaging news reports on the company and its management  More importantly  investors have voiced concerns  Enron s common stock price has plummeted and spreads on its debt have widened   The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its business  Approximately  1 5 billion of unused liquidity is available under committed bank lines   An additional concern is that certain structured transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II and Osprey could unwind  While various sources of repayment exist  such as the sale or liquidation of underlying assets  or an equity offering  primary credit support is derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120 days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger event  In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes in either case  Enron is required to deliver additional shares  If Enron cannot or does not deliver on its obligation  then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of Enron  representing a general unsecured claim  While trigger events include a downgrade of Enron s senior unsecured debt below investment grade by one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with specified declines in Enron s closing stock price over three consecutive trading days  Enron would have a forebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was being made to register the shares  The total amount of Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately  3 2 billion  Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt   While capital market uncertainties have escalated  Fitch has no information to indicate that there are any fundamental problems with Enron s core wholesale  retail  and pipeline businesses  Fitch expects to be in contact with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor ongoing events and address strategic  longer term issues    STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow  10 25 2001 AFX News  c  2001 by AFP Extel News Ltd  NEW YORK  AFX    Share of Enron were higher in opening trade  after the company dismissed its chief financial officer  Andrew Fastow  due to his past involvement in running two partnerships  in which Enron had invested  dealers said   At 9 56 am  Enron was up 1 13 usd  or 6 95 pct  at 17 55  The DJIA was down 138 60 points at 9 207 52  the S P 500 index was down 15 95 pts at 1 069 00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39 02 at 1 692 52  Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow  after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow related transactions    In my continued discussions with the financial community  it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO   said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement   Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships  LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co Investment LP  which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company   McMahon  who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron s Industrial Markets group  had quit his job as treasurer last year  after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow s role in running the two partnerships  according to the Wall Street Journal   This morning  Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to  buy  speculative   from  buy high risk   to reflect his concerns that  lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron s commercial operations     This is the least likely outcome  in our view  but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked   he said   ng lj For more information and to contact AFX  www afxnews com and www afxpress com  Copyright

Edmiston     Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES      NEW YORK  Dow Jones   Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit quality of troubled Enron Corp   ENE   but they have made almost no changes in policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas  the companies said Thursday      The concerns have arisen because Enron  which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country s power and gas markets  has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure      Moody s has put Enron s credit on watch for possible downgrade  and some of the company s debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week       We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron   said John Sousa  chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc   DYN    It s business as usual       Williams Cos   WMB  spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company  too  has made no changes and has no concerns about Enron s credit  Another Top 10 power and gas trading company  Aquila  ILA   has also left Enron credit unchanged      Other companies expressed concern  though they ve taken little if any action      Like everyone else in the marketplace  we re proceeding with caution   said Lora Kinner  director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing  the North American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S A      Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn t expect to make any drastic changes       Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues By Andrew Dowell Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  10 25 2001 Dow Jones Energy Service  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    NEW YORK   Dow Jones   Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos   WMB  to book  180 million in power sales from the previous period as third quarter revenues  the company said Thursday   The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator  which runs the state s wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions  The state of California has paid more than  11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers  but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state s ailing utilities in mid January  Two weeks ago  however  the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back    It s that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO   Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday   Williams reported third quarter net income of  221 3 million on revenues of  2 81 billion  up from  121 1 million on revenues of  2 33 billion in the same period the year before   Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales  The process is complicated by the state s role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities  which aren t creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves  The ISO didn t envision third party guarantors when it set up its settlement process  and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month  state power officials have said   The state says it has set aside  1 2 billion to cover ISO transactions   As reported  suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free   Willing To Renegotiate   Separately  Williams  officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long term contracts with California  provided the result benefited both parties   California Gov  Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed   Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power supply obligations   perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market  Malcolm said    We re always willing to sit down with a customer   Malcolm said   Williams hasn t been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts  Malcolm said   Any attempt by California to force through one sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants  he said    To the extent contracts are changed  financing is going to go away   he said   Downplaying Enron Opportunities   Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market leader Enron Corp   ENE   saying it focuses on large  long term structured deals  not the high volume  physical market transactions that Enron dominates  Malcolm said   Also  TradeSpark   the Internet based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner   is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron s proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald  X CFZ  suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center    That s interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing   Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call   Enron  which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country s power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline  has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure   Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline  a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades  Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark    We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers   Malcolm said   TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc   ESPD   Cantor Fitzgerald  X CFZ   Shell  RD  unit Coral Energy

2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup  Stocks are expected to open with losses Thursday  weighed down by disappointing U S  economic news and the European Central Bank s decision to leave interest rates unchanged  About an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened  futures on the Standard   Poor s 500 stock index were sharply lower  suggesting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will post a 94 point loss at the opening bell   In one of a trio of negative economic reports  the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods  or products expected to last more than three years  tumbled 8 5  in September  That was a much steeper drop than the 0 9  decline forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets   Meanwhile  the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 504 000 for the week ended Oct  20  That was more than the 500 000 jobless claims expected by economists   The Labor Department also said that the employment cost index rose 1  in the third quarter  slightly more than expected  The indicator measures changes in compensation costs  including wages and salaries  as well as costs for employee benefits   Later  at 10 a m  EDT  the National Association of Realtors is expected to say that 5 26 million existing homes were sold last month  down from the 5 5 million sold in August   Prior to release of the economic news  S P futures had pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street  after the ECB left rates alone despite growing political pressure for another rate cut to help the stumbling European economy   In addition to pouring over Thursday s economic reports  investors will spend much of the session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports  said Peter Cardillo  director of research at Westfalia Investments   Among companies that announced quarterly earnings so far  Dow Chemical said third quarter net income plunged 84

a gain of 0 7   and Hong Kong s Hang Seng Index rose 0 2    In Wednesday s session  Wall Street continued to shrug off disappointing earnings news  and focused instead on hopes that low interest rates and the government s economic stimulus program will produce a recovery   Technology issues saw much of the buying  with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 27 10 points  or 1 6   to 1731 54  The Dow industrials inched 5 54 points  or 0 1   higher to close at 9345 62  despite substantial losses in two of its components  Eastman Kodak and AT T  which issued weak outlooks   In major U S  market

I just want to say that the guy is gone now                That s the new news here   Did you read  did you know that               Fastow  after four                  Faber   Late yesterday                 Kernen   Yeah  after four o clock  Fastow is gone   What s               interesting                  Faber   He s the CFO                  Kernen   But he s a new CFO                 Faber     who benefitted personally from some of these               off balance sheet partnerships                 Cramer   Mark  you know  I m not on thin ice here  I m not               on thin ice                 Haines   I just want to make sure we understand that this               is your theory                 Cramer   This is my theory                 Haines   OK                 Cramer   It is just a theory   It is my opinion   But I               think we ve got to find out more about that short squeeze               that occurred                 Haines   OK                 Cramer   We need to find out whether it was orchestrated                 Kernen   The new CFO might help regain some credibility for               the company because he was the old treasurer who left that               position a year or so ago because of some disagreements               with how Mr  Fastow was doing business apparently   So now               he s back as CFO and we ll whether that calms the market               down                 Faber   Well  what they need to do   Joe  they need to come               clean   I mean  that is what all the investors in Enron and               those who ve left the company as investors over this last               week have wanted   Let s see everything  be as transparent               as you possibly can be  tell us exactly what we need to               know   And as much as they need to come clean with their               investors  they need to come clean with their trading               counterparties because that is really what people are               concerned about                 Kernen   Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big               deal   Anyone who does trading with them  if their credit               worthiness were to go  if their credit rating were to go               down  how would that affect energy trading                 Faber   Well  you want to know that they re going to be               there on the other side and make good on the trades                 Kernen   I guess you would  wouldn t you                 Faber   Right   Not that they aren t  but why would you  if               you can trade with seven other guys  seven other companies                maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there                 Kernen   Now  why would                  Faber   And that would hurt their core business                 Kernen   Why are people expecting some type of action from               the credit agencies  not because of the stock price  right                Because of something that could unravel                  Faber   Because of something related to these liabilities               they may have                  Kernen   That they don t know about at this point                 Faber     that they may have with regard to funding some of               these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped               in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at               the off balance sheet partnership   Will it be a liability                They don t know   But that s one of the reasons                  Kernen   We re talking hundreds of millions or billions                 Faber   They don t know                 Kernen   But there were billions of dollars in limited               partners                 Faber   Yes   About three billion in financing  I think is               what some analysts estimated                 Kernen   This is a pretty big number                 Faber   Yeah  they can get to most of that with the assets               that they have in the partnerships themselves                 Kernen   I use a six month chart to show what s happened               over the last two weeks   You got to look at here   But if               we went back a year  you d see eighty as far as the high               for Enron   Now we re at sixteen                 Faber   Everybody else took a hit yesterday   Dynegy got               hurt                 Kernen   Well  I got Dynegy next   Don t    Here we go                 Faber   I m sorry   I m getting a little excited                 Kernen   You are                 Faber   Enthusiastic about your charts                 Kernen   There s a weekly chart of Dynegy  and you know               what s coming next  don t you   Now I m worried about the               utility average   I ve worried about the transportation               average a lot in my career   Mark  now the utilities have               replaced my worries   I m angst ridden   Did you see this               chart   We re breaking below the                  Cramer   That s a positive  not a negative  Joe                 Kernen   What s wrong with Cramer today   What happened                 Cramer   I m all fired up                 Faber   He really is   My  God  he s got the DOJ getting               all crazy  the FBI  the CIA   You going down to En  you               going down to Houston yourself                 Cramer   I may just have to   I may have to clean up that               whole city                 Kernen   Jim  why would the  that s the  now getting down               to the lows  I mean  the other averages have come back               quite a bit from the post attack lows  the utilities are               retesting those   That s not something to worry about                 Cramer   No  because I think there s a lot of money going               into more cyclical issues   I think the economy is showing               signs of getting better   The consumer is certainly much               stronger than we thought   The base book didn t say the               corporate was strong  but the consumer is strong   Much               stronger than before                 Kernen   All right   In the past people have worried about               the utility averages being a leading indicator  though   I               don t  we re talking about four hundred to two ninety at               this point   That s a long way                 Cramer   This average has got a lot of problems to it  but               I still think that                  Kernen   It s no longer the                  Cramer     you sell this as safety   We don t want safety               as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality                                    '

October 07  2001 11 22 PM To  Lagrasta  Fred Cc  Dyk  Russell  Zivic  Robyn Subject  Back office issues    Fred    There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately   We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market   Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon   2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint   here s a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months      I shouldn t have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out    It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven t received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade    We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for    We did not trade 300 contracts per day  it was per month   do you guys even think before you type    I am a CFO and an accountant and I can t decipher what you are trying to confirm here     From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers  One  upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said  they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare   they couldn t rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm   This was a captive client who and needs to trade    who will not show us their flow again    The latest is the most disturbing    we just want to do a small trade to test your system  We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves   I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude  And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details  not one phone call to confirm the trade   nothing   We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently  Well  clearly we failed  We do not understand what is going on in the back office   Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business   Is there too much turnover  How are they trained   Who is in charge of the  backoffice    There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process   who co ordinates all their efforts   Does anyone care   Ok   I ll stop   For our part  we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December  we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her    We have to stop this before we lose clients  which we will      All the problems are being caused by the following   1  Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients   This has already cost us money this year  Our clients do 10 trades a day   they are constantly in and out of positions   it is imperative that we get these right   As well  this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system   There are hundreds of books at Enron   We have postions on with dozens of them   We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot   We have to select books one by one   this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow   Michelle is in charge of this process   We need a IT person on this yesterday   Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates   Robyn  Russell  and I check it everyday   there are always mistakes   2  There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them   There is no check after they have been imput   There are ALWAYS imput errors   Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward     We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals   We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin s starts   for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish   2a  Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered   what if deals are imput incorrectly  the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client   Going forward  confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct   2b  Invoicing   there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done     3  EOL  We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here   we have signed Renaissance up  a 10B program fund  but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks     4  Credit  All of our clients are margined   If deals are in the system incorrectly  the wrong MTM goes to the client   another mis match   We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients   this amount changes daily  we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through   again  we are doing this now              '

had to build in an escape hatch  If the stoc  k price failed to rise sufficiently  investors could  put   that is  sell    the bonds back to the company  in many cases  after just one year  And that s exactly what s about to happen  to the tune of some  65 billion   over the next three years  Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas  t half of these special hybrids  the prospect of conversion is now absurd    It simply won t happen  So bondholders are looking to get their money back   the first chance they can  And because of the put feature  that is possible    Suddenly companies like Tyco  Comcast  and dozens more are on the hook fo  r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they d never have t  o pay  20 That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies  After all    they re the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt   comes due  Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay   bondholders  Companies without enough cash   and the majority fall into th  is camp  are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow   money anew  That means sharply reduced earnings  Especially at risk are inv  estors in companies with poor credit ratings  prime candidates for killer r  efinancing costs  Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o  ff the debt  creating significant shareholder dilution  especially at curre  nt depressed prices  To make matters worse  this is happening at a time whe  n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin  king   This is a ticking time bomb   warns Margaret Patel  manager of the P  ioneer High Yield Bond fund  a top performing junk fund  20 The seeds of this mess were sown in mid 2000  when the stock market started   to falter  Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling   stock while their share prices were struggling  Zero coupon convertible bo  nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn t have to ma  ke cash interest payments on the bonds  hence the name  zero    Instead iss  uers offered an up front discount  for instance  investors would buy a bond   for  700 and collect  1 000 when it matured  20 Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n  umber of common shares  But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo  uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantly  in many cases  b  y more than 50   With that protective feature  called the conversion premiu  m   zeros took off  Corporate issuers would pay no interest  and once their   stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels  the debt would be swep  t away into equity   If the bonds are converted  it s a home run for everyb  ody   says Jonathan Cohen  vice president of convertible bond analysis at D  eutsche Bank  20 That four bagger  of course  depends entirely on the stock price rising  If   it doesn t  the bondholders  armed with that handy put feature  can simply   sell the bonds back to the company  Great for bondholders  but not so hot   for the company or its shareholders  But  hey  what are the odds of that ha  ppening   CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u  p   says Cohen   They don t worry about the bond getting put   20 If all this seems a little complicated  that s because it is  A real life e  xample should help  California based electric utility Calpine issued  1 bil  lion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt  At the time  the company   s stock was trading at about  55 a share  severely undervalued in the opin  ion of company management   We really didn t want to sell equity at that po  int   says Bob Kelly  Calpine s senior vice president of finance  So the co  mpany instead opted to sell zeros  setting the conversion premium at a heft  y 37   20 Still  with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si  gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile  the bonds weren t exactly a scre  aming buy for investors  So Calpine added the put feature  Investors could   sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric  e  eliminating any downside risk  20 Things haven t exactly worked out as management had hoped  The stock has si  nce plummeted to  25  and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens  e  So it s looking as though Calpine will be liable for the  1 billion in b  orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April  Th  ere s also the refinancing cost  According to Kelly  Calpine s borrowing ra  te could run in the neighborhood of 8 5   an extra  85 million per year in   cash   Obviously  nobody plans for their stock to go down   Kelly says   I   don t think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put     20 Calpine s potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i  s straddling junk   If you are a borderline investment grade company  a fin  ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the   world   notes Anand Iyer  head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta  nley  The problem is  there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r  atings out there  Jeff Seidel  Credit Suisse First Boston s head of convert  ible bond research  estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall   into the junk category  And others are at risk of having their ratings dow  ngraded before the put date  Today  with junk yielding as much as 5 1 2 per  centage points above bonds rated investment grade  refinancing can be a pri  cey proposition  20 Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high   price of junk  It has  845 million in zeros that it will probably have to b  uy back this January  and another  4 2 billion coming down the pike over th  e next couple of years  Because of slower  than expected sales  the company   was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies  And if   Solectron s credit is downgraded  the zeros would slide into junk status    a situation that could cost the company  and its shareholders  tens of mill  ions of dollars in refinancing charges  20 Refinancing isn t the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros  Comp  anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds  up to 3  of th  e amount raised  If the debt is sold back  many will have spent millions fo  r what essentially amounted to a one year loan   They re getting bad advice     claims one banker who didn t want to be named   Look at the fee the bank  er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into   20 As if those potential consequences were not scary enough  shareholders can   also get whacked when the bonds are first issued  That s because some 40  a  re bought by hedge funds  which short the company s stock  sell borrowed sh  ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price  at the same t  ime that they buy the bonds  If the stock goes down  the shorts make money   from their position  If it goes up  they profit by converting the bond to s  tock  This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet  at l  east for a while  Grocery chain Supervalu  for example  recently lost 10  o  f its market cap the day it announced it was issuing  185 million in zeros    20 Despite all the pitfalls  the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu  es  thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro  vide  In fact  the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form   of financing  Even better  thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code  companies c  an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they re act  ually paying  All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest   if certain conditions prevail  Verizon Communications  for instance  would   pay 0 25  annual interest on its  3 billion in zero bonds if its stock pri  ce falls below 60  of the issue s conversion price  In the eyes of the IRS    oddly  that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction    for tax purposes  of 7 5   the same rate it pays on its regular debt   Wh  y  Trust us  you don t want to know   That adds up to an annual deduction o  f more than  200 million  even if Verizon never shells out a dime in intere  st  Not surprisingly  more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain si  milar clauses   It s an incredible deal for them   says Vadim Iosilevich  w  ho runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management   Not only are they   raising cheap money  they re also doing tax arbitrage   20 So despite the enormous risks to shareholders  companies continue to issue   zeros at a steady clip  According to ConvertBond com  seven new issues  tot  aling  3 5 billion  have been sold since Oct  1 alone   I think the power o  f the tax advantage is going to keep them around   says CSFB s Seidel  Call   it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly  it   doesn t really matter  Either way  it s the shareholders who ll be

is a rough era for American business icons  Subject to the vagaries of   age  Jack Welch   product failure  Ford Firestone tires   competition  Luc  ent  AT T   technology  Hewlett Packard and Compaq   and dot bomb bubbles    CMGI   managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky busin  ess  The latest example is Enron  whose fall from grace has resulted in a p  roposed fire sale to Dynegy  20 Once considered one of the country s most innovative companies  Enron becam  e a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conf  licts of interest  The journalistic accounts of Enron s struggles drip with   schadenfreude  hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mi  rage  We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation    We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is n  eeded  High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norm  s  But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh re  velations emerge  Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that h  ave enduring value  20    Deregulation and market competition  Enron envisioned gas and electric p  ower industries in the U S  where prices are set in an open market of biddi  ng by customers  and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit  En  ron was the leader in pioneering this business  20 Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U S   and is   spreading to Europe  Latin America  and Asia  The winners have been consume  rs  who have paid lower prices  and investors  who have seen competition fo  rce the power suppliers to become much more efficient  The contrary experie  nce of California  the poster child of those who would re regulate the powe  r industry  is an example of not enough deregulation  20    Innovation and the  de integration  of power contracts  Under the old re  gulated model of delivering gas and electricity  customers were offered a o  ne size fits all contract  For many customers  this system was inflexible a  nd inefficient  like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure   by the truckload  Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the e  xact needs of the customer  20 To do this  Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent   parts  starting with price and volume  location  time  etc   and offered c  ustomers choices on each one  Again  consumers won  Enron s investors did t  oo  because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors  Arguabl  y  Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the    process of Creative Destruction   But creative destroyers are not necessari  ly likable  pleasant folks  which may be part of Enron s problem today  20    Minimization of transaction costs and frictions  Enron extended the logi  c of de integration to other industries  An integrated paper company  for i  nstance  owns forests  mills  pulp factories  and paper plants in what amou  nts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate ac  tivities better than smaller  specialized firms  Enron argued that integrat  ed firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from burea  ucracy and the captive nature of  customers  and  suppliers   Enron envisio  ned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the   bet that the free market terms would be better than those of the internal   operations  The development of free market benchmarks for the terms by whic  h divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy   for the economy  20    Exploiting the optionality in networks  In the old regulated environment    natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pi  peline  Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a nu  mber of possible sources  opening the customer to the benefits of competiti  on  and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies    Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network  so that they cou  ld nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any mome  nt in time to the best use  and choose when and where to convert molecules   to electrons  This policy  picked up by others in the industry  created tre  mendous value for both customers and suppliers  20    Rigorous risk assessment  The strategy of tailored contracts could easil  y have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the tradi  ng risks that the firm assumed  and of very strong internal controls  Enron   pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among th  e best anywhere  Particularly with the advent of Enron Online  where Enron   made new positions valued at over  4 billion each day  it became essential   to have up to the second information on company wide positions  prices and   ability to deliver  20 The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by   the firm  but with fears among trading partners about Enron s ability to fi  nance its trading activity  In a world where contracts and trading portfoli  os are too complex to explain in a sound bite  counterparties look to a thi  ck equity base for assurance  It was the erosion in equity  rather than tra  ding risk  that destroyed the firm  20    A culture of urgency  innovation and high expectations  Enron s corporat  e culture was the biggest surprise of all  The Hollywood stereotype of a ut  ility company is bureaucratic  hierarchical  formal  slow  and full of excu  ses  And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company    Enron only 15 years   ago    is even duller and slower  Enron became bumptious  impatient  lean    fast  innovative  and demanding  It bred speed and innovation by giving it  s professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses  create markets  an  d transfer within the firm  20 Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion  and an ope  n office design fostered brainstorming  The firm s organization and culture   was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a l  arge corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs  This was a lightning   rod for the firm s detractors  And yet  it could serve as a model for more   hide bound enterprises to emulate  20 Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformatio  n of American business  It created a ruckus in once quiet corners of the bu  siness economy  It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in   which it did business  It thrived on volatility  20 The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R D establis  hment  especially given Dynegy s track record as a second mover following E  nron s lead  Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time consuming ant  itrust review  Dynegy s greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enr  on s spirit of innovation its own  Or so we all should hope  because prospe  rity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake

is weighted toward health care and consumer staples  a  s well as cyclical stocks such as energy and farm equipment  20 The quarter was among the roughest in years for Wall Street investors  The   terrorist attacks of Sept  11 helped contribute to the stock market losses    which drove down the value of all portfolios in the survey  though the mar  kets have since recovered to their pre Sept  11 levels  The last time the g  roup posted results this bad was during the third quarter of 1998  during t  he Asian financial crisis  20 Goldman Sachs Group Inc  and Credit Suisse Group s Credit Suisse First Bost  on finished at the bottom of the pack  falling 23 2  and 30 1  respectively    The performance of last place finisher CSFB was dragged down by losses at   companies such as Veritas

the Enron Corporation  people close to the discussions said today  20 Enron is looking to sell Wessex Water  of Britain  as well as other noncore   assets in India and Brazil  after a financial crisis

Landesbank Girozentrale of Dusseldorf  or Wes  tLB  is among several suitors for Wessex Water  people close to the discuss  ions said  The sale has also attracted the attention of industry rivals lik  e Thames Water  owned by RWE of Germany  But such a combination would most   likely incur a long review by regulators  who might either block the merger   on antitrust grounds  or exact stiff

19 2001 The Wall Street Journal C1  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    When AT T last week completed the second biggest bond sale in history    ca  pping one of the busiest bond periods in years    it came as welcome news a  mid fears of a credit crunch  Here was new money  meaning new spending on p  lants  equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump    20 That  10 9 billion AT T deal  and a slew of similar bond deals from big com  panies ranging from Boeing and Anheuser Busch to Kraft Foods and General Mo  tors  may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on  That   is because corporations  like homeowners  are in the midst of a refinancing   boom  Corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap  but b  ecause they often can t get money in other crucial markets  In particular    they are sidestepping the commercial paper market    short term corporate I  OUs used to finance day to day operations  where rates traditionally are lo  west    because investors are unwilling to finance many well known corporat  ions  20 The result has been a huge jump in bond sales  the majority of which are us  ed to reduce existing debt  Since the Sept  11 terrorist attacks  about  13  5 billion in investment grade bonds have been sold  up from about  78 billi  on in the year earlier period  Overall issuance this year is likely to set   a record  clearing  600 billion  compared with  411 billion in 2000  20  The driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short   term commercial paper to long term debt   says John Lonski  chief economist   at Moody s Investors Service  a credit rating agency  20 Usually  rising bond issuance presages economic growth  In 1991  corporatio  ns sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates  But the  n  companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operation  s  a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1  990s  20 This time around  the surge in bond deals won t pump in enough new money to   the economy to make a dramatic difference  Though  as in the case of the m  illions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly   payments  it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate balance s  heets and help to fund some of the companies  day to day operations  20 Not all of the money being raised is to refinance short term debt  of cours  e  and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation s biggest bor  rowers have ready access to funding if they need it  20 But most companies are similar to AT T  which last week provided the bigges  t refinancing example yet  20 Over the next three months  the telecom company was facing  6 5 billion in   expiring commercial paper  Under normal conditions  corporations pay off ma  turing commercial paper by  rolling over  that debt  or issuing new commerc  ial paper to replace the old  But rolling over commercial paper became much   harder for AT T after Moody s cut the company s short term and long term c  redit ratings  Through the bond deal  AT T raised money at relatively attra  ctive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial paper market    20 Other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives   to the commercial paper market through bonds  loans or revolving credit lin  es   The ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital marke  ts   says Meredith Coffey  senior vice president at Loan Pricing Corp   a d  ebt market analysis company  20 For the most extreme cases  the bond markets don t offer refuge  Enron  ham  mered by a third quarter loss of  618 million that led to a string of downg  rades  drew down  3 3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay   investors in its commercial paper  It then turned to its banks for an addit  ional  1 billion loan to pay off more commercial paper investors  thus tidi  ng it over until it could merge with rival Dynegy  20 Most investment grade companies aren t nearly so bad off  and thus have rea  dy access to bond investors  General Motors  for instance  had little troub  le selling  6 billion in debt last month  while Ford Motor easily sold bond  s totalling  9 4 billion  20 But the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment grade companie  s are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their mone  y  20 Take Ford  Standard   Poor s and Moody s downgraded Ford s debt ratings las  t month to triple B plus and single A 3  respectively  With that rating  Fo  rd is far enough down the spectrum of investment grade debt that many of th  e ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won t touch it  meaning t  hat it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt  Ford concedes   that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the comme  rcial paper market  20 Boyce Greer  the money market group leader at Fidelity Investments  says he   often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign   of eroding profitability    even before they get downgraded   You can t wa  it around for a rating agency  to downgrade a company    he says  20 Moody s has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so   far this year  Thus  the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk t  o  1 4 trillion at the end of October  down from  1 6 trillion at the end o  f last year  20     20 Friday s Credit Markets 20 Last week was a brutal time to own Treasurys  The market sold off so sharpl  y as to push yields  which move inversely to prices  almost back up to wher  e they stood before the terrorist attacks  It was the worst bond selloff si  nce 1987  according to economists at Banc One Capital Markets  20 Losses were heaviest in issues like the two year note  the most sensitive t  o expectations about Federal Reserve policy  Since hitting a record low of   2 30  on Nov  7  the two year yield has risen 0 80 percentage point to 3 05     In the same period  the 30 year bond yield has risen 0 50 percentage poi  nt to 5 27   20 At 4 p m  Friday  the benchmark 10 year Treasury note was down 1 3 32 point  s from late Thursday  or  10 94 per  1 000 face value  at 100 25 32  Its yi  eld jumped to 4 897  from 4 756  Thursday  20 The 30 year Treasury bond s price fell 1 19 32 to 100 25 32 to yield 5 317    up from 5 211  Thursday  20 Why the selloff  People in the market cite a shift toward the view that the   U S  economy may

All Rights Reserved  Dynegy s  9 8bn rescue bid for Enron  the larger rival energy group  poses   complex and unprecedented regulatory challenges for the Federal Energy Regu  latory Commission  Ferc   which is likely to lead the review of the bid  20 Officials from the two Houston based companies  which announced the deal 10   days ago  estimated the regulatory process would take six to nine months t  o complete  But the Ferc review could take longer  according to experts  and approval o  f the deal is further complicated by such issues as the parallel Securities   and Exchange Commission investigation into Enron s finances  20  It s very complicated  It will be very time consuming   said one person cl  ose to the Ferc commissioners  As of Friday  the groups had not yet filed f  or Ferc approval  20   The deal  raises issues that have never been considered before by Ferc     said Edward Comer  general counsel to the Edison Electric Institute  the as  sociation of US electric utilities  20  It has never considered the merger of two huge marketers  and in the past    marketing wasn t considered as significant a portion of the energy sector   as it has become   20 A typical deal now takes about 200 days to win Ferc approval  But Mr Comer   said approval of the Dynegy bid could take anywhere from six months to two   years  20 The agency s guidelines prohibit mergers if

 European and Asian markets sagging and terrorism   worries abounding  Russia s risky markets seem less so these days  20 So far this year  Pilgrim Russia Fund  which was bought by ING Groep NV lat  e last year  has been the top performing regional mutual fund  gaining 53     according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc  By comparison  the Standard   P  oor s 500 stock index has slumped nearly 14   Of course  the risks in Russia remain  Despite recent economic gains  the c  ountry still is struggling with a weak banking system  inadequate state ins  titutions to enforce contract laws and few businesses run by the  modern  r  ules of corporate governance  according to Samuel Oubadia the 37 year old m  anager of the Russia fund  20  But they are getting more open   Mr  Oubadia said  though Russia s lax fin  ancial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign   investors  With  49 million in assets  the Pilgrim Russia fund invests bet  ween 90  and 95  in Russian stock  with the balance held in cash  20  While the global economy is slowing  Russia is still in an expansion mode     Mr  Oubadia said  After years of economic reforms  consumer spending is u  p 10  and the former Soviet Union s gross domestic product is expected to g  row 3  to 5  next year  more than twice as much as that of the U S  and Eur  ope  20 Two thirds of the fund s stocks are oil and gas companies  which are still   the most liquid stocks in Russia  Utilities  mining  telecommunications com  panies and breweries make up the rest   There s no escaping oil and gas if   you want to manage a Russia fund   Mr  Oubadia said  20 The spike in oil prices earlier this year made the investment in oil worthw  hile  propelling earnings growth for Russia s oil and gas companies  Higher   oil prices also worked wonders for the Russian economy  which is largely d  ependent on oil and gas  More recently  however  falling oil prices have th  reatened the companies  profit growth  20 But the fund manager  who is based in The Hague  said he doesn t think peop  le should invest in Russian oil stocks because of their earnings prospects     You don t invest because of earnings growth    there will be none for Rus  sian oil companies this year  You invest because of the stocks  low valuati  on   Mr  Oubadia said  adding that most of the Russian oil companies still   trade well below the world wide average for the sector  20 Yukos Oil is one of the fund s largest investments  making up about 12  of   the fund s holdings  Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil Holdings also make up more t  han 5  each of Pilgrim Russia s assets  While Mr  Oubadia said the companie  s should be able to handle falling oil prices  partly by cutting production    he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile Russian stoc  k market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks  20  Can Russian markets do well with lower prices for oil   he asked   The sho  rt answer is yes  But how low will prices drop   Mr  Oubadia acknowledged t  hat weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and   gas into other Russian sectors  including telecom stocks and consumer produ  cts  20 The Russia fund isn t for the timid  In 1998  when the Russian economy coll  apsed  the fund    then called Lexington Troika Dialog Russia  lost 83  of   its value  A year later  the fund soared 160   In 2000 the fund finished do  wn almost 18   20     20 JANUS STOCK SHUFFLE  Janus Capital Corp  bulked up on lower priced value st  ocks and shed some shares of its long held technology

Financial Times  11 19 2001 National Post National FP3  c  National Post 2001  All Rights Reserved   NEW YORK   Companies that trade with Enron Corp   the Houston  Texas based   energy group  are taking precautions in case Dynegy Inc   also of Houston    withdraws its  15 6 billion rescue bid for its rival  a decision that could   trigger a crisis in the energy trading market  20 Counter parties to Enron  which is one of the principal market makers provi  ding liquidity in the energy market  are seeking to limit their exposure to   the group  in spite of reassurances from both Enron and Dynegy that the ta  keover will go through  Experts also say the implications of the deal are so complex that the regul  atory review could take much longer than the six to nine months company off  icials have estimated  20 Analysts say the 27  spread between the value of Dynegy s offer price and E  nron s share price suggests a 65  to 75  chance the bid will succeed  But b  ankers and energy executives are still worried about systemic risk  both in   the energy market and in financial markets  where companies such as Enron   use derivatives to offset the risk of energy price fluctuations  20 Enron was close to meltdown until Dynegy stepped in with a rescue bid 10 da  ys ago  having persuaded credit rating agencies not to downgrade Enron s de  bt to below investment grade  20 Clauses

sector A V Rajwade  11 19 2001 Business Standard 10 Copyright  c  Business Standard  Every foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit  Of these  t  he most controversial has been Enron and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd  DPCL     This apart  the experience of investors in the  reformed  power sector i  n Orissa is also unhappy  Five years ago  Orissa was the first state to ado  pt the World Bank recommended model of separating generation  transmission   and distribution of power  and an independent regulator  The Godbole Commit  tee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well  20 Clearly  separating the three functions is a complex restructuring  Maybe i  t helps privatisation  the current fashion on the subject having been set i  n Thatcherite Britain  While some privatisations in UK have succeeded  the   experience has not been consistent all over  Take UK s rail sector  While privatising  the government in its wisdom deci  ded to separate the ownership of the rail network  Railtrack  and the owner  ship and operation of trains  The contractual relationship between the vari  ous operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine  bewilde  ringly complex system of penalties and incentives  to be monitored by an in  dependent regulator  20 Such separation had no parallel  Besides  Railtrack suffered from poor mana  gement  cost escalation in modernisation of tracks  etc  Several serious ac  cidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult  The  reform  d  id not work  and Railtrack was put back under public control last month  20 What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeedin  g  Pretty poor  if the experience of Orissa is any guide  It faithfully sep  arated the three functions  and privatised distribution and part of generat  ion  AES  a foreign company  was 49 per cent investor in a generating compa  ny  and 51 per cent in CESCO  a distribution company  As Gajendra Haldea an  alysed in this paper on August 27   The policy and regulatory framework was   inadequate and myopic   20 Distribution losses  a euphemism for power theft  were much larger than the   companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation  CESCO defa  ulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO  the transmission company  which in turn   defaulted to the generating company  Indeed  all CESCO s cash inflows are   now escrowed  leaving it no money even to pay salaries  For all practical p  urposes  the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation  pe  rhaps beyond redemption  and the  reform  is a total mess  20 The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is   less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingnes  s to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers  For a while  cr  oss subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the househol  d and the agricultural segments  20 However  as the burden became too large  the commercial sector started movi  ng to captive generation  further worsening SEB finances  An  independent    regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem  He may fix economic   prices but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors  puni  sh power thiefs  face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is c  ut off  So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative  as    sadly  they are  the institutional restructuring is no substitute for subst  antive action  No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to   get out  20 Enron too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country  over   and above its dispute with MSEB  It had attracted a lot of adverse publici  ty for gouging power consumers in California  a state in a power crisis  se  e World Money  February 2  2001   The Internet craze also had a hand in Enr  on s misfortunes  It became an energy trader  established an electronic tra  ding platform  had broadband ambitions  went into a disastrous diversificat  ion in water supplies which  if I remember correctly  led to Rebecca Mark s   exit  Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skilli  ng  ex McKinsey  and was notorious for opaque  complex accounts  20 To top it all  last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary    1 2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act  ivities  Enron s chief financial officer  who was supposed to be in charge   of these  has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated   with him was involved in them  The SEC is investigating the affair and Enr  on s share price is down 67 per cent since mid October  There are some repo  rts that Shell may make a bid for Enron  20 After its ratings were downgraded  Enron is desperate for liquidity and anx  ious to dispose its assets  DPCL was already on the platter  now a sale has   become even more urgent  Reportedly  Tatas and BSES are interested  so are   the lending institutions  Clearly  if a settlement is to be reached  this   is the optimum time  20 But one is not very optimistic  For one  Delhi and Mumbai will be involved    and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs  Our byzantine decisi  on making processes make timely decisions impossible  Further  if a deal do  es take place  there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption  It i  s much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and De  lhi to allow the drift to continue  to  let the law take its own course   w  hatever the costs  Sadly  as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper  Indian polit  icians respond to developments only out of compulsion  not conviction   Copyright

JARNOLD  Non Privileged  pst  Good Morning   Bottom line  No Changes   Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall early winter pattern  no Arctic air  over the next 2 days  This pattern will persist through the end of the month   For the near term  1 5   Bottom Line   Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South  The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return  The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week  Details  We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow  with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow  By Tuesday  the South and Texas will be in the below normal category  with Dallas overnights in the mid 30s  normal low 43   Houston s low 40s  normal upper 40s  and Chicago will freeze  with a mid 20 overnight  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday  Philly and New York will get into the below normal category  but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation  6 10 Day Bottom Line  Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation  Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions  NO strong Arctic air is expected  Details  A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal  At the same time   the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing  By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U S  bringing widespread rain and snow  Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East  11 15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation  While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon   temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow   So  with normals dropping across the nation  this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation s gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf d plus regime from here on through the winter  Here s the strip beginning with today  Sun  11 18  47 Bcfd  Mon  11 19  54 Bcfd  Tue  11 20  67 Bcfd  Wed  11 21  69 Bcfd

t have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out    It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven t received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade    We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for    We did not trade 300 contracts per day  it was per month   do you guys even think before you type    I am a CFO and an accountant and I can t decipher what you are trying to confirm here     From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers  One  upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said  they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare   they couldn t rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm   This was a captive client who and needs to trade    who will not show us their flow again    The latest is the most disturbing    we just want to do a small trade to test your system  We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves   I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude  And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details  not one phone call to confirm the trade   nothing   We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently  Well  clearly we failed  We do not understand what is going on in the back office   Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business   Is there too much turnover  How are they trained   Who is in charge of the  backoffice    There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process   who co ordinates all their efforts   Does anyone care   Ok   I ll stop   For our part  we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December  we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her    We have to stop this before we lose clients  which we will      All the problems are being caused by the following   1  Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients   This has already cost us money this year  Our clients do 10 trades a day   they are constantly in and out of positions   it is imperative that we get these right   As well  this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system   There are hundreds of books at Enron   We have postions on with dozens of them   We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot   We have to select books one by one   this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow   Michelle is in charge of this process   We need a IT person on this yesterday   Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates   Robyn  Russell  and I check it everyday   there are always mistakes   2  There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them   There is no check after they have been imput   There are ALWAYS imput errors   Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward     We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals   We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin s starts   for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish   2a  Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered   what if deals are imput incorrectly  the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client   Going forward  confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct   2b  Invoicing   there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done     3  EOL  We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here   we have signed Renaissance up  a 10B program fund  but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks     4  Credit  All of our clients are margined   If deals are in the system incorrectly  the wrong MTM goes to the client   another mis match   We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients   this amount changes daily  we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through   again  we are doing this now              '

pare U S  payrolls    There s nothing out of  the  ordinary planned for the rest of the business   said company spokeswoman Karen Denne   We are continuing to hire in the businesses most rapidly growing    Those growing businesses include Enron Wholesale Services  she said   Earlier Thursday  Dow Jones Newswires reported the company would cut between 5  to 10  of its European staff  or as many as 500 workers   This past summer  the energy company announced staff reductions at its Enron Broadband Services division  The number of employees affected by this decision wasn t immediately available  Ms  Denne said   Before Thursday s announcement  the company s shares were trading lower on the New York Stock Exchange  But in afternoon trading today  shares of Enron  ENE  were up  1 11  or 3 3  to  34 60  With these latest gains  the stock is now up about 40  from the three year low of  24 46 set a week ago   For several months  Enron shares have been under pressure as investors struggled to assess the impact of a number of negative developments  including declining energy prices  the recent and sudden departure of its chief executive  disappointing performance of its broadband unit and difficulties at its Indian power plant project   The stock has made steady progress this week as investors shopped for bargains or were encouraged by progress Enron made in its plan to divest itself of some overseas assets   On Wednesday  Enron announced the sale of some Indian oil and gas assets to BG Group PLC  BRG   a United Kingdom oil and gas company   J P  Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said the stock also received further support by the reaffirmation of earnings forecasts at rivals Dynegy Inc   DYN  and Aquila Inc   ILA  in recent days     Write to Christina Cheddar at

Europe By 5  10   10 04 2001 Dow Jones Energy Service  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    LONDON   Dow Jones   Enron Corp   ENE  is looking to cut its workforce in Europe by up to 10   or around 500 jobs  Enron Europe Chief Executive John Sherriff said Thursday    We have around 5 000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between 5  and 10   but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance   Sherriff replied in a written response to questions by Dow Jones Newswires  The cuts are the first significant retrenchment by Enron since it arrived in Europe in 1989  Enron has been the most aggressive U S  energy company to expand into Europe s deregulating markets  but its core energy trading businesses have been held back by the slow and piecemeal progress toward market liberalization in the E U   The company declined to be more specific about how far it will scale back individual product lines or coverage of certain geographical businesses    Enron s product range in Europe has mushroomed over the past year  continually giving rise to market talk  notably among its competitors  of overstretching itself prematurely in underdeveloped markets    Enron s business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions  but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth   Sherriff said    It is prudent for us to keep both a close eye on our costs and to continually review the skills and resources that are available to use  to ensure that they are deployed in a way to maximize earnings   he added   While trading volumes have exploded in core markets such as U K  power trading since wholesale market reforms were introduced in March  liquidity in other products such as bandwidth  monomers and credit risk  is understood to have developed more slowly and restricted the volume growth needed to justify Enron s pure trading strategy   Enron has been among the most prominent exponents of a new philosophy in energy markets that places far more emphasis on risk management skills than the physical ownership of assets  a radical change from the asset heavy approach to energy that prevailed in Europe before the E U  s deregulation directive came into effect in 1999   As such  it has in the last 18 months disposed of assets such as its stake in Sutton Bridge power station in England and has conspicuously refrained from buying  brownfield  physical assets in markets such as Italy and Germany   However  it has pursued various greenfield independent power projects and the acquisition of gas trading licenses in markets such as Spain and Italy    By Geoffrey T  Smith  Dow Jones

Schivley said   The companies aim to have a transition plan ready by the time federal energy regulators rule on the combination  Select Energy has said it plans to keep Niagara Mohawk s Syracuse office open   The company won t release the terms of the deal until it closes  which is expected in late November   Select has annual revenues of about  2 5 billion  Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing had revenues of  635 million in 2000   Select Energy is still looking at further acquisitions of trading operation and generating assets in New York and the Mid Atlantic  Schivley said    This is more than just window shopping   Schivley said   We are actively seeking out hard assets    The company isn t interested  however  in the two other unregulated units Niagara Mohawk is looking to sell in

 Pacific NW Lawmakers Gear Up To Oppose FERC RTO Mandate By Bryan Lee  10 04 2001 Dow Jones Energy Service  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   WASHINGTON   Dow Jones   Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the U S  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission s mandate for consolidation of power grid assets in the region  The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC s effort to establish a regional transmission organization  or RTO   The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns  which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the region s consumers   FERC shouldn t force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost benefit analysis  said Rep  Peter DeFazio  D Ore   who is spearheading the effort   Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesday s hearing  DeFazio complained that  a bunch of bureaucrats  at FERC are embracing the national power grid agenda of Enron Corp   ENE  without assessing the costs and regardless of  what it does for local reliability    DeFazio s complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday s hearing   The region already enjoys an open and competitive transmission network  thanks to the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration  according to hearing testimony expressing concern that RTO West  as the RTO proposed for the region is called  will cost more to implement than it will provide in benefits    We are troubled that RTO West will not achieve any net benefit for end use consumers in the Northwest   the Public Power Council testified   Although work is beginning on a cost benefit study  we are troubled that a transmission system that has served us all well for so long will be disassembled because FERC has announced that RTOs  by definition  are good     Regional transmission organizations may be necessary to remedy the transmission ills in other regions of the country  but not in the Northwest   declared a group of transmission dependent utilities    The  balkanization  and isolation of transmission systems that characterize most other regions is simply not present in the Northwest  For this reason  the economic power side benefits of an RTO will be relatively small   said a group of aluminum producers   Similar cost benefit concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators in the Eastern U S  who oppose FERC s effort to consolidate grid assets under large RTOs in the Southeast and Northeast    RTO Week    FERC Chairman Pat Wood III acknowledged the complaints Thursday  adding that he expected to address the concerns of regulators and industry during  RTO Week  Oct  15  when the commission will hold five days of hearings on the commission s RTO mandate    I think I need the decisionmakers at the table  We ve had the lawyers in the suits arguing about it for eight years now   Wood said at an  energy community  forum sponsored by Enron in Arlington  Va   Wood told Dow Jones Newswires following his remarks at the Enron forum that FERC answered the complaints about the lack of a cost benefit analysis at its Sept  26 meeting   The commission agreed to undertake a comprehensive analysis in support of its claim that RTOs will bring about operational efficiencies that will translate into consumer savings   Wood also noted a study by Mirant Corp   MIR   which concluded that combining the three independent system operators in the Northeast into a single RTO would produce  440 million in annual consumer benefits   During the Enron forum  Edward Meyers  a regulator with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission  urged Wood to seek out the input of affected state regulators   Meyers noted that he is in the minority among regulators in the region in supporting the Northeast RTO grid consolidation  while most others oppose the effort as  economically dangerous    Arnetta McRae  chairman of the Delaware Public Service Commission  told Wood that her fellow state regulators aren t so much opposed to grid regionalization but the lack of consultation by FERC   The state regulators want  an opportunity to be at the table   McRae said  If such a process were offered  there would be a lot less opposition  she predicted   FERC is reaching out to address the concerns of state regulators  Wood said  adding that he was  blindsided  by the opposition among state regulators to FERC s grid consolidation mandate   Later in the day  Wood told reporters that  RTO Week  will feature an entire hearing devoted to the concerns of state regulators   At the Enron forum  Wood defended the commission s RTO policy  which calls for carving up the nation s interconnected electricity system under the control of four or five large RTOs  as necessary to jump start the overly long transition from regulation to competition    This process needs to be goosed   said Wood  calling FERC s RTO orders  an external catalyst  to get the process moving    If I m wrong  I d love to find a better way around that   he said    By Bryan Lee  Dow Jones Newswires  202 862 6647  Bryan Lee dowjones com  Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved     USA  NewPower signs up 50 000 new electric users in Texas   10 04 2001 Reuters English News Service  C  Reuters Limited 2001   NEW YORK  Oct 4  Reuters    The New Power Co  said Thursday the electricity grid operator in Texas is processing requests from over 50 000 residential customers who have chosen New Power as their new electricity provider   The Electric Reliability Council of Texas  ERCOT  is responsible for processing the requests to switch customers for all utilities and competitive retail electric service providers during the state s deregulation pilot program  NewPower said in a statement  The switching process could take anywhere from two weeks to two months before consumers will actually begin to receive power from a competitive retail electricity provider   New Power said it has captured more than half of the customers who decided to switch to new providers from the Reliant Energy HL P and TXU Corp  markets   The New Power Co   a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings  Inc    is the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers in deregulated power markets in the United States   The Texas pilot power deregulation program began on July 31 after it was delayed two months due to computer problems   The entire state is slated to begin full retail competition on Jan  1  2002   A spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas told Reuters previously that about 120 000 residential customers had signed up for the pilot program   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved     States protest federal involvement in electricity competition  deregulation By H  JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer  10 04 2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001  The Associated Press  All Rights Reserved   WASHINGTON  AP    North Carolina and several other states told the Supreme Court the government went too far when it ordered electric utilities to open their power lines to competitors and spurred a movement toward deregulation   But one of the country s largest power marketers  Enron  argued before the court Wednesday that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should have gone even further to help companies like Enron get equal access to power grids  During the hourlong hearing  the justices gave little indication of how they will decide on a case that could dramatically affect management of the nation s power grids and the future of electricity competition   At one point  Justice Stephen Breyer said FERC  which regulates wholesale power markets and interstate transmission of power  was being  whipsawed  from both directions   The commission s 1996 decision  which for the first time required traditional utilities to open their transmission lines to competing power merchants  triggered a movement toward wholesale electricity competition and led numerous states to end monopolies in retail power markets   But utility regulators in nine states  led by New York  filed suit arguing that the FERC order amounts to a federal agency attempting to regulate retail sales  usurping a traditional state function   At the same time  Enron s lawsuit charged that FERC violated federal law because it did not require access to transmission lines when utilities continued to keep transmission and retail sales as one operation   as remains the case in many states that have yet to allow competition   In June 2000  an appellate court essentially upheld FERC s regulation  prompting appeals from both Enron and the state regulators    It s an example of where an agency has overstepped its bounds   Lawrence Malone  general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission  told the justices at Wednesday s hearing  The other states party to the lawsuit are Florida  Idaho  New Jersey  North Carolina  Virginia  Washington  Vermont and Wyoming   Malone  appearing on behalf of all nine states  argued that FERC s order pre empts state authority to regulate retail sales and set rates    This case isn t about rates   countered Louis Cohen  representing Enron Power Marketing Inc  before the court   What we re concerned about is getting onto the  grid  system    Cohen said that under the current access rules a dominant utility in a state that has not moved to competition may still  hog  the lines and keep Enron and similar marketers from moving power across a region   The Justice Department  representing FERC before the court  argued that the commission only sought to strike a balance between the need to give competitors equal access to power lines and leaving retail market issues to the states   Edwin Kneedler  deputy solicitor general  told the court that FERC  in his view  could have gone further  as Enron has argued  But  he said  to do so it would first have had to order all utilities to separate retail sales and transmission  something it chose to leave to the states   The case  which is not expected to be decided until sometime next year  comes at a time of growing concern about electricity competition and power grid reliability in light of recent power problems in California   About half of the states have taken some steps toward retail electricity competition   Many power industry experts as well as the FERC commissioners have emphasized that a truly competitive electricity market will be difficult to achieve without smooth and efficient flow of electricity across large regions  if not nationally  And that  argue companies like Enron who want to compete with traditional utilities  will require more open access to transmission   In an attempt to smooth the flow of power  FERC has embarked on a campaign to establish four large  regional transmission organizations to manage the national power grid  A court decision rolling back some of FERC s authority over open access to transmission lines could affect that effort   Uncertainty over how far the federal government will be allowed to go in requiring transmission access also could affect state decisions on whether to embrace electricity competition  according to some industry experts        On the Net   Federal Energy Regulatory

terrorist attacks on Sept  11  the focus now is on how to  turn around the ensuing recession  The effect of President Bush s recently  proposed economic stimulus package is difficult to gauge given that consumer and  corporate spending remain so unpredictable  Experts agree  however  that the  timing of the stimulus will have a major impact on its success or  failure http   knowledge wharton

since the beginning of the 1990s  The Sept  11 terrorist  attacks in New York and Washington made matters worse  pushing the country into  what analysts say is Japan s fourth recession in a decade  But Wharton faculty  and outside market analysts add that some sectors of the Japanese economy should  be attractive for long term investors http   knowledge wharton upenn edu articles cfm catid 1

people now know  for  all its hubris the company has turned out to be one of the dot com economy s  most spectacular failures  After burning its way through  1 2 billion in  capital  it declared bankruptcy in July  But does Webvan s collapse mean that  shoppers dislike buying groceries online  For a part of the answer  look across  the Atlantic to a Britain based supermarket chain called Tesco  Its online arm   Tesco com  will probably have revenues of  420 million this year http   knowledge wharton upenn edu articles cfm catid 7 articleid 448  Finance and Investment Is Behavioral Finance a Growth Industry  Can  psychology really help us understand financial markets  Yes  say many academics   The subdiscipline of behavioral finance   which argues that investors are not as  rational as traditional theory assumes and that their biases can affect asset  prices   has gained ground over the past five years  Although behavioral finance  attracts powerful criticism   and at times is clearly been oversold    it seems  to be growing up  Experts at Wharton and other business schools provide some  perspectives http   knowledge wharton upenn edu articles cfm catid 1 articleid

undergo a major  transformation that would provide prescription drug coverage to the program s 40  million seniors  But that was before an economic slowdown and the Sept  11  terrorist attacks  Now there are new  more urgent priorities and it s unclear  just when the debate over drug coverage will again get underway http   knowledge wharton upenn edu articles cfm catid 6 articleid 442  Public Policy and Management Are  Government Bailouts Bad Business  Even the most cold hearted  free marketer would concede the airlines got a tough break in the two day  grounding after the terrorist attacks  No manager could have been expected to  anticipate events on the scale of Sept  11  or to set aside enough money to  cover the revenue shortfalls that followed  So a government bailout is a  reasonable response  right  Not necessarily  say those who have studied past  examples of government bailouts http   knowledge wharton upenn edu articles cfm catid 9 articleid 446  Finance and

began trading futures contracts this morning on the S P Commodity Index  SPCI    a new standard for commodities pricing  Officials from the New York City Mayor s Office for Economic Development as well as NYBOT and Standard   Poor s presided over the launch   Standard   Poor s  a leading provider of global financial information and investment analysis  and the New York Board of Trade  a global marketplace for alternative investment products  developed the SPCI to bring greater definition to traded commodities as an investable asset class  The SPCI was introduced at a ceremony at NYBOT on August 9  2001  The SPCI futures and options allow managers and investors to add real diversification to their portfolios through a single  transparent access point to the investment opportunities found in commodity futures markets     The launch of this new product so soon after the events of September 11  and on a trading floor so imaginatively developed before the event  allowing NYBOT to start trading so soon after the loss of its facility in lower Manhattan  is a testament to the strength and the resilience of New Yorkers   said Michael G  Carey  President  New York City Economic Development Corporation   Let no one doubt that New York is and continues to be the financial and trading capital of the world     To contribute successfully to long term portfolio goals  an alternative asset should have certain key characteristics  namely a proper benchmark  transparency  liquidity  simplicity  cost efficiency and flexible trading capabilities   said NYBOT President and CEO Mark D  Fichtel   SPCI futures and options are among the few investment instruments that meet all the criteria for a real alternative asset  We believe that these new contracts will prove particularly valuable to investors and managers who need alternative investment strategies in these difficult economic times    The NYBOT SPCI futures contract lists six active contract months  January  February  April  June  August  November   Expiration is the second Friday of the listed futures contract month  and the contract is cash settled  The futures contract is valued at  100 x the Index  current contract value approximately  100 000   Trading hours initially will be 10 00 AM to 4 00 PM  New York Time   Options on futures are also offered  see contract specifications      SPCI futures and options give investors a direct means to obtain exposure to a diversified commodity basket   said Robert Shakotko  Standard   Poor s Managing Director of Index Services   Investors around the world recognize the S P reputation for equity indices and index products  We now bring these same business strengths to commodities     The SPCI tracks 17 commodities in six sectors including grains  meat and livestock  metals  softs  coffee  sugar  cocoa   fibers  and energy  The index utilizes real time prices of the relevant futures contracts traded on the commodities futures markets in New York and Chicago  Key features of the SPCI include its geometric calculation methodology and a weighting adjustment that eliminates double counting of upstream and downstream commodities    The new SPCI futures and options contracts will support and enhance other index linked investment products  They offer an easy and efficient way to manage commodity index funds  commodity linked insurance products  or commodity exposure in multi asset products  As with its equity indices  Standard   Poor s has initiated a licensing program for the SPCI directed at financial institutions that might use the new commodity index as part of an innovative investment product   End of day index values and index history are available through both the S P Index Services website at www spglobal com  http   www spglobal com indexmaincommodity html  and NYBOT s Website at www nybot com  http   www nybot com    The SPCI is calculated every 15 seconds and is available through traditional real time quote vendors via the NYBOT  the ticker symbol will be  I     Standard   Poor s  a division of The McGraw Hill Companies  NYSE  MHP   provides independent financial information  analytical services  and

mid 30s and lows in the mid teens By Tuesday  Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category  with Dallas overnights in the mid 30s  normal low 43   Houston s low in the mid 40s  normal upper 40s  and Chicago will freeze  with a mid 20 overnight   Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday  Philly and New York will get into the below normal category  but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely   Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the     6 10 Day time period  which will see a cool shot over the Midwest East towards next weekend  moderating again by early the following week  Then  early in the     11 15 Day time period  more cool air moves in  beginning with central cooling  then even into the Southeast   So  with normals dropping across the nation  this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation s gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf d plus regime from here on

Producer       Amsterdam  Oct  16  Bloomberg     Reliant Energy Inc   the owner of Houston s utility  said it hired Merrill Lynch   Co  to find a buyer for its Dutch power generation business  two years after acquiring the company from the government for  2 3 billion        Reliant has already been approached by possible buyers  said Clyde Moerlie  a spokesman for Reliant Energy Europe  The unit  which doesn t have any household customers  earned  9 million in the second quarter compared with  26 million a year earlier        The U S  company may struggle to get the price it paid for the Utrecht based unit  formerly known as UNA  analysts said  on expectations heightened competition will erode profit further and as utilities increasingly seek customers as well as power plants        In the Dutch generation market    there aren t many opportunities  but prices will fall to much lower levels as growing competition pushes down tariffs    said Steven de Proost  an analyst at Delta Lloyd Securities in Antwerp        Houston based Reliant paid 2 9 times sales for UNA in 1999  while Electrabel SA  Belgium s dominant power provider  paid 2 7 times sales for Epon  the biggest utility in the Netherlands  E ON AG of Germany paid 1 6 times sales the same year for the generator NV Electriciteitsbedrijf Zuid Holland  or EZH        Reliant joins rivals TXU Corp  and Edison International in reassessing its European business amid disappointing earnings  Reliant in July tied the second quarter profit drop in Europe to increased competition and falling margins in the Dutch market                               Enron Cuts       Enron Corp  said last week it will cut 10 percent of its European workforce  while Edison Mission Energy agreed to sell two U K  power plants to American Electric Power Co  on Monday        The U S  utility said last month it was considering a sale of the Dutch business after it was contacted   by a number of parties who have expressed an interest   in its European assets  and as it reallocates capital to fulfill   growth objectives          Merrill already advised the Dutch state on the original sale of UNA to Reliant  the only time a U S  company has taken control of a continental European utility  This year  Merrill ranks sixth in advising on transactions involving a European utilities target  with  6 9 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions        Potential buyers for UNA  which provides about 20 percent of the Netherlands  electricity  are likely to be companies already present in the Dutch market  such as Nuon NV  Eneco  or Spain s Endesa SA  analysts said  UNA may also attract generation companies including Mirant Corp  and International Power Plc        Atlanta based Mirant and International Power predecessor National Power Plc both bid for UNA when it was first put up for sale  Central and Northern Europe are   areas we re interested in    said Aarti Singhal  an International Power spokeswoman          We re looking at all options    said Fransce Verdeuzeldonk  a spokeswoman for Nuon  in an interview                            Spanish Interest       Endesa  Spain s largest power producer  agreed to buy Remu NV  the No  4 electric utility in the Netherlands  for 1 5 billion euros last December  The completion of the transaction has been held up by the Dutch government  which wants at least 51 percent of utility company shares to remain in the hands of public authorities until at least 2004        An Endesa spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the company would be interested in UNA  Endesa said in July its purchase of an Italian generator was enough to meet its goal of having 8 000 megawatts of capacity in Europe outside Spain        Based in Utrecht in central Netherlands  UNA is one of the four main power generation companies in Holland  operating six power plants  It had 1998 sales of about  800 million and is one of the only generation companies in the market up for grabs

 The Hindu  Fin  Times Info Ltd Asia Africa Intel Wire  Business Line  The Hindu  Copyright  C  2001 Kasturi   Sons Ltd  All Rights Res d  NEW DELHI  Oct  15  INDUSTRIAL Development Bank of India  IDBI   the country s largest development financial institution  appears to be heading for some serious trouble   A revised set of figures placed by the institution to the Ministry of Finance has indicated a cash requirement of Rs 7 000 crore over the next three years  much of which it is finding difficult to tie up  Besides  it has also placed a request for a Rs 3 000 crore equity infusion from the Government  The revised financial projections were placed before the Finance Ministry last week by an IDBI team headed by the Chairman  Mr P P  Vora  The meeting was attended by the Advisor  Ministry of Finance  Dr Rakesh Mohan  the Additional Secretary  Capital Markets Division  Mr S K   Purakayastha  and the Deputy Governor  Reserve Bank of India  RBI   Mr G P  Muniappan   At a meeting on October 5  IDBI had placed its capital infusion requirement at Rs 2 500 crore and immediate fund requirement at about Rs 5 500 crore   Officials have been particularly concerned over IDBI s admission that it has been struggling to raise resources from the market due to the rating downgrade in August despite its massive requirements  It has also admitted to the Ministry that it may be heading for losses during the current fiscal  According to sources  the institution has admitted that the losses could spill over to the subsequent year unless assistance comes at an appropriate time   IDBI has said the capital infusion of Rs 3 000 crore is being sought to write off a portion of the institution s huge portfolio of non performing assets  NPAs   which at the end of fiscal 2000 01 stood at over Rs 9 000 crore in gross terms   The institution has argued that only a massive NPA write off would enable it to get back its rating  thereby allowing it to tie up the funds requirement from the market  IDBI s rating was downgraded by Crisil from AAA to AA  recently   IDBI  which was directed by the Government to submit a three year cash flow statement during the October 5 meeting  has said the additional cash requirement for the three years alone stands at Rs 7 000 crore   Of the cash requirement  the immediate need includes a Rs 2 200 crore repayment arising out of the institution s decision to exercise the call option on its earlier bonds series  The repayment would be due in March 2002   Moreover  the institution also wants to keep itself ready in the event that

from one of my    colleages at JPMorgan  It s been sent around within the firm  I wanted    to pass it on just in case     Hi All      I think you all know that I don t send out hoaxes and don t    do the reactionary thing and send out anything that crosses my    path     This one   however  is a friend of a friend and I ve given it    enough credibility in my mind that I m writing it up and sending it out    to all of you     My friend s friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month    ago   She had a date with him around 9 6 and was stood up  She was    understandably upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied     On 9 10  she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that    he    wished he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it    had to be like that   The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her    not to get on any commercial airlines on 9 11 and to not to go any malls    on Halloween     As soon as everything happened on the 11th  she called the FBI and has    since turned over the letter  This is not an email that I ve received    and decided to pass on   This came from a phone conversation with a    long time friend of mine last night     I may be wrong  and I hope I am   However  with one of his warnings    being correct and devastating  I m not willing to take the chance on the    second and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same    information that I did     Laura Katsis    Implementation Specialist    714 921 5424    lkatsis volt com  mailto lkatsis volt com     OpsVolt Track volt com

from this newsletter                  PRACTICES  1  Discipline above all else   Now that technological advances and the globalization of the economy have assured virtual teaming a place of permanence in today s business world  the task at hand is to make this brand of teamwork as effective as possible  Authors Jon Katzenbach and Douglas Smith emphasize discipline as the key to virtual team success  This article outlines a number of helpful suggestions from their latest book   The Discipline of Teams   including establishing clear goals  setting measurable objectives  and agreeing upon specific work rules   http   www kinetic clippings com clippings 1001 clip1 htm  2  Officing Alternatives Getting a Second Look in the Aftermath   Necessity is the mother of invention   It may also be the mother of acceptance prompting people who might otherwise disregard the new or the different to give it a try when there are few other alternatives  While Telework and other Alternative Office concepts are not new by any means  many employers and employees alike  affected by world changing events like the terrible tragedies of September 11th are looking for creative strategies to get people back to work until they can get back to their offices   http   www kinetic clippings com clippings 1001 clip2 htm  3  Should Employees Pay to Work from Home   For employers who make the commitment to develop and deploy a Telework program for their employees  the costs associated with adequately equipping remote workers may be slightly higher than for their in office counterparts  However  in contrast to the costs of providing office space  these expenses are truly insignificant  This article is an example of how Siemen s decided to disburse home office allowances   http   www kinetic clippings com clippings 1001 clip3 htm  4   Think Global  In Fortune Magazine s Sept  3rd Edition  IDRC presented an in depth look at the value of an  integrated workplace   one that supports technology  services and people  in a changing economy  Check out this feature to learn more  and to see results from Kinetic Workplace s State of the Industry survey   http   www kinetic clippings com clippings 1001 clip4 htm                  DESIGN  5  RSI  Politicians argue   Is there a link to computer use    As politicians continue the battle over federal ergonomic regulations in the workplace  scientists are waging their own fight over the cause of the repetitive stress injuries  RSI   whose incidence such regulations are aimed at reducing  Some researchers argue that  contrary to popular belief  there is not a link between heavy computer use and RSI  particularly carpal tunnel syndrome  Other researchers point to a large body of research documenting such a link  This article reviews evidence on both sides of the issue   http   www kinetic clippings com clippings 1001 clip5 htm  6   Is  Big Brother  such a bad thing when it comes to home safety   While many companies that allow telework focus on the safety and security of their networks and data  the issue of the worker s physical safety in the home office is often overlooked  The lines of responsibility are not clear  leaving workers uncertain about what they need to do and companies fearful of being perceived as being  Big Brother  if they intrude too much into their worker s homes   Jeff Zbar points out the need to ensure that your Home Office is safe and secure  and provides a security check list for the home office  and a short questionnaire to test your home office s security and safety  These three articles underscore the need for teleworkers to have a formalized policy that clearly outlines both their and their employer s responsibilities in providing a safe and secure home office  Addressing these issues up front and in writing eliminates any uncertainty   http   www kinetic clippings com clippings 1001 clip6 htm                  TECHNOLOGY  7  Free High Speed Wireless Net Access  With the demise of Ricochet  the high speed wireless access carrier  some bandwidth junkies have turned to free wireless networks  These  freenets  are set up by users via the Wi Fi standard and cable or DSL modem sharing  Cable carriers call them illegal  while users say it s a solution to the last mile problem   http   www kinetic clippings com clippings 1001 clip7 htm  8  More Trouble for DSL With the demise of several providers  the DSL equipment market is shrinking  pushing users towards lower cost cable modems provided by more stable companies  This may impact which DSL equipment provider you choose for your remote access solution  as there may be other vendors exiting the market should the downturn continue   http   www kinetic clippings com clippings 1001 clip8 htm  9  Tech talk for your home office  This article takes a look at the types of technologies companies are providing their teleworkers in order to create a high tech office at home  Check out this article for the cost implications of outfitting home offices and discover some of the pros and cons of tools  dial up services and security solutions   http   www kinetic clippings com clippings 1001

friend of mine who has a lot of close friends from India   This letter is to one of those close friends   I don t know if I should pass it around but I want everyone I know to be aware   Kim        This is worth forwarding  just incase                                                                                                                                                PLEASE READ     Subject  Malls on 10 31        Hey guys  I dont want to scare anyone  but its better safe than sorry     right   This is not just a foward I recieved  Its from one of my    colleages at JPMorgan  It s been sent around within the firm  I wanted    to pass it on just in case     Hi All      I think you all know that I don t send out hoaxes and don t    do the reactionary thing and send out anything that crosses my    path     This one   however  is a friend of a friend and I ve given it    enough credibility in my mind that I m writing it up and sending it out    to all of you     My friend s friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month    ago   She had a date with him around 9 6 and was stood up  She was    understandably upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied     On 9 10  she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that    he    wished he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it    had to be like that   The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her    not to get on any commercial airlines on 9 11 and to not to go any malls    on Halloween     As soon as everything happened on the 11th  she called the FBI and has    since turned over the letter  This is not an email that I ve received    and decided to pass on   This came from a phone conversation with a    long time friend of mine last night     I may be wrong  and I hope I am   However  with one of his warnings    being correct and devastating  I m not willing to take the chance on the    second and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same    information that I did     Laura Katsis    Implementation Specialist    714 921 5424    lkatsis volt com  mailto lkatsis volt com     OpsVolt Track volt com  mailto OpsVolt Track volt com

all available sources  including actual market feedback  weather and other fundamentals  and uses curve building functions and other existing tools as transfer functions  along with your own thinking  your processing functions that your neurons are wired up to do   could help the neural network to learn and eventually provide the necessary predictive power     Ravi Thuraisingham  CFA Director

trade after Me  rrill Lynch issued a cautiously optimistic note upgrading the stock to  buy    from  accumulate  following Enron s sale of certain US and Indian assets    dealers said  At 11 35 am  Enron gained 36 cents  or 1 08 pct  to 33 81 us  d  20 The Dow Jones Utility Average  DUX  declined 4 26 points to 316 05  20 On the broader indices  DJIA lost 16 26 points to 9 051 68  the S P 20 500 fell 3 50 to 1 058 90  while the Nasdaq composite dropped 23 21 points lower to 1 583 53  20  In a note issued early this morning  Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey sa  id  the agreement to sell Portland General and its India oil and gas intere  st  has positioned the company to focus on its more profitable core busines  ses  while substantially reducing its debt load by the end of 2002  The sale of Portland General is expected to add 1 88 bln usd of cash to the   company coffers at the close of the transaction fourth quarter of 2002  Th  e deal will also bring 1 1 bln usd of debt relief  20 Meanwhile  the sale of Indian oil and gas assets should bring in 388 mln us  d  20 Eassey expects more asset sales by the company in the near future  20 The divestiture of the troubled Dabhol power facility in India along with s  maller international gas assets could provide the company with additional l  iquidity  he said  20  Enron could ultimately  in the next 3 years  raise another 1 8 bln usd or   so from Dabhol and other non core international assets   20 The Dabhol plant is 65 pct owned by Enron  making it the biggest investment   in India by a non Indian company  20 The company s partner  Maharashtra State Electricity Board  MSEB   owns 15   pct  MSEB owes Enron 48 mln usd for past power bills  but claims the power   is too expensive and says it cannot absorb it all  The plant has lied idle   since  20 Many questions  however  remain unanswered  said Eassey  noting that despit  e the upgrade he is remaining cautious  20  While Enron has a menu of assets to draw upon to raise capital  reduce deb  t and improve its earnings prospects in the process  the primary question c  entres on timing   he said  20  Will the asset sales line up with an expected balance sheet clean up  with   prospective gains offsetting losses   20  Can Enron sell its interest in Dabhol anytime soon  given the current war   environment  20  What impact will the weakening economies of South America such as Brazil a  nd Argentina  not too mention the negative economic sentiment here in the U  S  have on Enron s and other internationally diverse companies  earnings ou  tlook   20 These issues  along with the earnings drag from about 967 mln usd invested   in its broadband unit and the viability of its 3 5 bln usd of goodwill  wil  l likely continue to weigh on the stock near term  explained Eassey  20 Reflecting the above uncertainties  Eassey said he is  cautiously lightenin  g  his 3 year growth outlook from the 20 pct range to 16 17 pct a year  Ear  nings per share estimates for 2001 stand at 2 10 usd  while the 2003 foreca  st is 2 45 usd  20 Accordingly  Eassey s  long term  price objective now stands at 44 usd  or   31 pct above its current price with an

Bernadette Tansey Chronicle Staff Writer  10 09 2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A 13  Copyright 2001   Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California s energy mark  et are turning the tables on the state  saying its independent grid manager   is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov  Gra  y Davis  administration  20 The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator    which is legall  y required to act as an impartial market manager    of improperly helping s  tate power buyers spread out the cost of high  priced electricity contracts    Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mys  terious charges on their accounts with the grid agency  said Jan Smutney Jo  nes of the Independent Energy Producers Association  which represents such   industry giants as Enron  Dynegy  Williams and Reliant  20 The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resourc  es was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an av  erage of  69 per megawatt hour for as little as  1 per megawatt hour  20  The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Wate  r Resources is giving them   Smutney Jones said  20 An industry source said NRG Energy Inc  and other suppliers were preparing   a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  which could   order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been   improperly charged  20 The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid m  anagement agency  20 State officials bought power under long term contracts when it appeared Cal  ifornia could suffer serious power shortages over the summer  Instead  the   state had more than enough power  and electricity available on the spot mar  ket suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought  20 Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum  an industry group  said t  he grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing pr  actices to  bury  some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the a  ccounts of other generators  20  The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity  and they control   the governing board of the ISO   Ackerman said  20 The governor s spokesman  Steve Maviglio  called the power firms  accusatio  ns  absolutely false  and said the generators were trying to whip up sentim  ent in Washington to interfere with the state s affairs  20  The generators know they ll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in   Washington than they will in Sacramento   Maviglio said   It shouldn t be   a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement     20 Oscar Hidalgo  a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources  said gene  rators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California s energy crisi  s  20  I don t feel sorry for them one bit   Hidalgo said   They had one heck of   a year   20 Gregg Fishman  spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a respon  se to the accusations  20 Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mec  hanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs  20 The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers  bills for ISO operat  ing costs  which all electricity sellers in California share  Ackerman said    20 Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for res  ale  only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more exp  ensive state power  Others say the grid operator orders them to activate st  and by power units on too short notice  When they can t comply  they say  t  he ISO brings high priced state power on line and bills them for the extra   cost  20 The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California s grid  In   January  Davis disbanded the ISO s 26 member governing board  which was ch  aired by Smutney Jones  after some critics said it was too cozy with indust  ry  Davis appointed his own five member board  20 In February  then FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become    a political arm of the governor   The commission is trying to get Californi  a to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization  20 Davis has warned Washington to  keep its hands off  the

Ore   Oct 08  2001  AP Online via COMTEX     Northwest Natural Ga  s Co  is buying another Oregon utility from Enron Corp  for  1 8 billion  c  ombining the state s largest natural gas and electric utilities in a merger   that may save ratepayers money but could also bring some job losses  Richard G   Dick  Reiten  chairman and CEO of Northwest Natural  said Monda  y the gas company is buying Portland General Electric Co  after the Houston   based energy giant gave up on its expansion into the Pacific Northwest   We re extremely pleased that the acquisition will return PGE to local owne  rship   Reiten said at a news conference  Bob Jenks  executive director of the Citizens Utility Board  said he was co  ncerned the combination could encourage Northwest Natural to bypass state r  egulators by using its business clout to lobby the Legislature and governor   s office when rate increases are needed   If that s going to happen  and PGE rate cases are fought out in the Legisl  ature and the governor s office  then I don t think that s going to be in t  he interest of PGE customers   Jenks said  Northwest Natural was founded in 1859  the year Oregon became a state  usin  g gas extracted from coal to light downtown street lamps  PGE was founded in 1889 with a hydroelectric generator at Willamette Falls   that anchored the nation s first long distance electric transmission line w  hen it was connected to the city  14 miles to the north  The plant still op  erates  generating 16 megawatts of electricity  Reiten said the Northwest Natural board of directors has rejected buyout of  fers itself in recent years in hopes that an opportunity like the PGE deal   would come along   It was a conscious choice to remain independent and build assets rather th  an sell out of state   Reiten said   That patience has paid off   He said the deal will create a  5 billion utility that can cut costs by com  bining repair crews  equipment  service centers and billing in their overla  pping service area  Portland General has about 733 000 customers in northwestern Oregon and Nor  thwest Natural has about 530 000 customers in roughly the same area  includ  ing some in southwestern Washington state  Their headquarters are just a fe  w blocks apart on the same downtown street  Federal and state regulatory approval  along with shareholder approval  is   expected to take about a year  Some job cuts were expected  but Reiten said he hoped most would come throu  gh attrition and retirement  rather than layoffs  He said regulators have looked favorably on recent mergers of gas and elect  ric utilities because they generally have saved money for ratepayers  Combi  ned utilities already serve about two thirds of the nation  he added  Enron purchased PGE in 1997 for about  3 2 billion  including assumption of   debt  hoping to tap into energy trading along the entire West Coast  from   California to Washington state  But the Texas company found the pace of der  egulation in Oregon too slow at a time when the California energy crisis wa  s unfolding  Enron has a history of buying and selling smaller companies as it searches   for the best position in the constantly shifting energy market  said Mike H  eim  an A G  Edwards   Sons analyst who follows the Texas company   It s really more a strategic move   Heim said  Enron will receive  1 55 billion cash and  350 million in securities for PG  E  Enron stock closed at  33 45 on Monday  up  1 72 per share  Northwest Natur  al was at  22 99  down 42 cents a share      '

more often and on more routes because the planes   are more efficient than large planes to fly when traffic is light  20 The trend has not brought new sales  Brown said  but has helped firm up ord

 23  Bloomberg     Over lunch in a conference room at Boston s Four Seasons Hotel last Thursday  Enron Corp  Chairman Kenneth Lay tried to convince analysts and investors that the company has no more surprises        With the analysts  he apparently succeeded  Enron remains one of Wall Street s most highly rated stocks  even after the largest energy trader acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of  1 2 billion in shareholder equity        Lay wasn t so successful with investors  who have abandoned Enron shares  slashing their value 42 percent in a week          You ve got a lot of people lining up to say the emperor has no clothes    said Richard Gross of Lehman Brothers Inc   who today repeated his   strong buy   rating on Enron  Analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston  Goldman  Sachs   Co  and other firms have also kept their highest ratings on Enron        Gross still likes the look of Enron s finery    The core franchise here is very valuable    he said  and the stock s decline more than reflects the   worst case   for the company        In Boston and at similar meetings in Houston and New York  Lay had to explain the unwinding of the partnerships  He and other Enron executives assured investors the company has no more surprises in store  according to Greg Phelps  who manages  1 1 billion at John Hancock Advisers Inc   and attended the Boston session        The partnerships functioned somewhat like private equity funds  according to analysts and investors  and included investments that lost money  The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for more information about them  Enron said yesterday                           One Hold  One Sell       While two analysts have cut their Enron ratings after learning about the partnerships  they only dented the company s popularity on Wall Street        Michael Heim of A G  Edwards   Sons Inc  in St  Louis lowered his rating to   hold   from   buy   on Friday  He said he has been looking for discussion of the partnerships in Enron s SEC filings and is only seeing   vague references   that don t leave him with a   good comfort level          With Heim s rating change  Enron went from being the second most highly rated stock in the Standard   Poor s 500 Index to the 10th  according to Thomson Financial First Call        Today  Zach Wagner at Edward Jones   Co  in St  Louis cut Enron to   reduce   from   accumulate    Ratings by Edward Jones  which caters to individual investors rather than institutions  aren t tracked by First

highly brokerage analysts rate the stock    I have to remain skeptical    said Barry Borak  energy analyst at David L  Babson   Co   which manages  60 billion in Cambridge  Massachusetts          There s been a huge loss of management credibility at Enron    Borak said  because of the partnerships and the unexpected departure in August of Jeffrey Skilling  who had held the post of chief executive officer for six months and was heir apparent to Lay    Nobody I ve talked to thinks  Skilling s departure  is for personal reasons    Borak said        Skilling helped transform Enron from a gas pipeline company into the biggest energy trading company  Enron also owns power plants in deregulated markets        Borak said Babson doesn t own Enron shares and won t be a buyer   until I can get better  more thorough information about what else might pop up in the future          Borak and other investors said Enron has a reputation for not providing enough information about its businesses  and they said this makes the positive view of the company on Wall Street more difficult to understand        After Skilling resigned  Lay said the company would be more open about its businesses  A bullet point in his talk in Boston was   increased transparency of financial and operating results    according to a handout provided at the Boston meeting                            Amazed  Dismayed       Prudential Securities Inc  analyst Carol Coale wrote in a note to clients last week that she was   amazed at the willingness of Enron s management to break out earnings and expenses to the degree that it disclosed in the third quarter          Coale also wrote that she was   dismayed by the apparent  disguise  of the additional  1 2 billion equity hit that was not disclosed in  Enron s  press release and was briefly mentioned in the earnings conference call    Coale kept her rating on Enron at   buy          Phelps at John Hancock said that his   cynical side   believes that investment banking business has helped keep Wall Street recommending Enron stock    They provide some good underwriting business    he said        Credit Suisse First Boston managed a secondary sale of 12 million Enron shares in 1999  with Lehman Brothers acting as co manager  Credit Suisse has also managed bond sales for Enron this year     Enron Asks Citigroup for  750 Mln Loan

Bloomberg     Enron Corp   the biggest energy trader  has asked Citigroup Inc  to arrange a  750 million loan  ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off from money markets  say people familiar with the matter        Enron s shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its finances  The company depends on a  3 billion commercial paper  or short term debt  program to finance day to day operations        Moody s Investors Service last week placed all  13 billion of the company s long term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade  Any drop in the rating may cut off Enron from the commercial paper market  raising the costs of short term debt          We understand that our credit rating is critical to both the capital markets and our counterparties    Enron s Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today  He said Enron has  3 5 billion available on bank credit lines  giving it enough cash to operate normally        Dan Noonan  a spokesman for Citigroup s Citibank NA unit  declined to comment  Mark Palmer  a spokesman for Enron  also wouldn t comment        Shares of Enron  based in Houston  fell 86 cents to  19 79  They have fallen 76 percent this year                            Complex Financing       An investor sued Enron last week  saying dealings with two partnerships run by Fastow  LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co Investment  cost the company  35 million  The suit also calls Fastow s leadership of the partnerships  set up to remove debt from Enron s books  a conflict of interest        Enron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions in some partnerships run by Fastow  said Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay on the conference call with investors today        The number of shares differs from a Wall Street Journal report on Thursday that said Enron had bought back 55 million shares  The buyback reduced shareholder equity by  1 2 billion  the Journal said        The company set up the partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy Enron assets such as power plants  The partnerships allow Enron to take debt off its books  letting it borrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading  Enron said  Enron trades electricity  natural gas  oil  coal and other commodities           They have complex off balance sheet financing    said Commerzbank analyst Andre Mead    It s difficult to ascertain the full impact on shareholders          The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated companies headed by Fastow  The company has at least  3 billion in such   off the books   financing in affiliated companies  Ray Niles  a Salomon Smith Barney analyst  wrote in a report to investors                         Depends on Asset Sales       One partnership  Whitewing Management  owns 250 000 preferred shares that Enron may have to convert to common stock  Whitewing partners can demand their preferred shares be converted if Enron common stock falls below a certain price or if Enron s credit rating drops under investment grade        Whitewing and other Enron partnerships and trusts include company executives as officers and directors  according to records from the Texas secretary of state          Over the life of these trust structures  Enron has in fact issued a sizable amount of equity    Enron Treasurer Ben Gilsan said  Most of that was shares issued to Enron executives as part of a deferred compensation plan  Gilsan said        The Whitewing partnership was financed with  1 4 billion in bonds sold last year  The partnership used some of the proceeds to buy Enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by selling them  officials said on the conference call  Other company partnerships operate with the same strategy          Some investors are worried the asset sales won t cover the full amount  borrowed   and Enron will have to furnish support to the detriment of shareholders    said Commerzbank analyst Meade                         Commercial Paper Rates       Enron was paying 3 15 percent to issue commercial paper until Oct  31  which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies with the same   A2 P2   short term credit ratings that are not on credit watch  Enron s short term debt is not on review for a possible downgrade        Based on Bloomberg composite ratings

values  one more giant banner between e  levator banks declares Enron s simple if grandiose goal   From the World s   Leading Energy Company to       The World s Leading Company    For a while  that future seemed guaranteed  as Enron transformed itself fro  m a stodgy  troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000    It was a Wall Street darling  with a stock price that increased 1 700 per  cent in that sixteen year period  with revenues that increased from  40 bil  lion to  100 billion   The very mention of the company in energy circles th  roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy     notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates  a firm that provides ma  rket intelligence to the energy business   This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling  a visionary determine  d to transform American business  Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b  y then CEO Ken Lay  Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old   formula of finding energy in the ground  hauling it in pipelines  and then   selling it to refineries and other customers  Instead  it evolved into a co  mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms  from natural gas   to electricity  from wind to water  If you had a risky drilling venture  E  nron would fund it for a piece of the action  If you wanted your megacorpor  ation s energy needs analyzed and streamlined  Enron could do the job  If y  ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning   power needs  Enron was there to build and build  Basically  if an idea was   new and potentially and fantastically lucrative  Enron wanted the first cra  ck  And with each success  Enron became ever more certain of its destiny  T  he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high tech wo  rld  and in February of this year  Skilling reaped his reward when he succe  eded Lay as chief executive officer  Enron  says Skilling   was a great mar  riage of the risk taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk taking me  ntality of the financial markets    The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en  d of the twentieth century  Like the high tech companies it emulated  Enron   was going to reinvent the American business model and  in turn  the Americ  an economy  Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a   culture that was based on absolutes  not just the old versus the new  but t  he best versus the mediocre  the risk takers versus the complacent those wh  o could see the future versus those who could not  The key was investing in   the right kind of intellectual capital  With the best and the brightest  a   company couldn t possibly go wrong   Or could it  Today Enron s stock trades at around  35  down from a high of    80 in January  The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California s ene  rgy crisis last spring  and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for   his relentless defense of the free market  A long troubled power plant pro  ject in India threatened the company s global ambitions  Telecommunications    in which Enron was heavily invested  imploded  Wall Street analysts who o  nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices  Some of the cha  nge in Enron s fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer  tain times that has afflicted all of American business  But the culture tha  t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame   ENRON  JEFF SKILLING SAYS  HAD  a totally different way of thinking about b  usiness we got it   At Enron  in fact  you either  got it  or you were gone   it was as simple as black and white  It is not coincidental  then  that th  e color scheme of Skilling s River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he   once headed  Here  the living room s white walls shimmer against the mahoga  ny floors  Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets  Billowy sofas set   off the jet black baby grand  In the entry  white orchids cascade from a b  lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold  white mar  ble  There is only one off color note  After almost twenty years  Jeff Skil  ling is no longer associated with Enron  having resigned abruptly after jus  t six months as CEO  Once  Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch  Gene  ral Electric s masterful CEO   as one of Worth magazine s best CEO s in Ame  rica  anointed in 2001   and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc  hained adventure junkets in which  a friend told BusinessWeek   someone cou  ld actually get killed   Today  he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr  istmas morning   I had no idea what I d let go of   Skilling says of all th  e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron  20  From a black chair in the white library  across from a huge black and white   photograph of his daughter and two sons  Skilling clarifies  The demands o  f working 24 7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances  Divorc  ed  he lived in a 2 200 square foot house without a microwave or a dishwash  er  He almost missed his brother s wedding   Learning a foreign language I   never learned a foreign language   he exclaims  He never once took his youn  gest son to school   I m interested in the kids  You don t do kids in fifte  en minute scheduling   Travel   You can t go to Africa for a week and get a  nything out of it   Skilling includes the study of architecture and design   on his list of missed opportunities  then he stops and sighs   I m not sure   that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO s job   he says  finally    Then his eyes lock on mine  and his voice  which had softened  regains it  s pragmatic edge   It would have been easy to stay   he says   But that wou  ld not have been good for me   20  He s a smallish  ruddy faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight  hand  some in the way of corporate titans  with piercing cheekbones and that assi  duously stolid gaze  But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious   underlings and dull witted utility company executives is now targeted at r  eporters who have labeled his resignation  bizarre  and associates who are   bitterly skeptical of his need for family time  His shrug stretches the lim  its of his shimmering blue button down  and his matching blue eyes look put   upon   I m surprised   he says   that people have so much trouble understa  nding this    PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni  neties couldn t help but notice a funny and  for its time  novel scene unfo  lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building  From nine t  o five and before and after  you could see people slipping out of the prist  ine silver skyscraper to smoke  They perched on the chrome banisters or lur  ked near the glass doors at the entry  puffing like mad  They always looked   hurried and furtive  even ashamed  Whatever people knew about Enron in tho  se days  and most people didn t know much   it was often associated with th  at scene  Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters   in Houston  and there couldn t have been clearer evidence of its break with   the energy world of the past  What macho engineer would have put up with s  uch humiliation   But this company was a child of another time  that period in the mid eighti  es when chaos enveloped the gas business  Federal deregulation of natural g  as turned a steady  secure industry  in which gas pipeline companies freque  ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served  into a v  olatile free for all  The situation was compounded five years later by fede  ral deregulation of the pipeline business  So it happened that a gentlemanl  y gas pipeline company  Houston Natural Gas  HNG  found itself under attack   from Coastal Corporation  Oscar Wyatt s less than gentlemanly firm  HNG wa  s then run by Lay  a sturdy  taciturn former economics professor and Transc  o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy   His doc  toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V  ietnam War   Lay  who was from Missouri and never succumbed at least outwar  dly to Texas brashness  had done well enough  Thanks to canny expansions  H  NG s pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat  e of Texas   HNG fended off Coastal  but to protect the company from other takeover atte  mpts  Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska   pipeline concern called InterNorth  one of the largest pipeline companies i  n the country at the time  Then  a funny thing happened  HNG started acting   in a way that would characterize the company for years to come a lot like   Coastal  What the Nebraskans blithely labeled  the purchase  was being call  ed  the merger  back in Houston  and before long  following some particular  ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston  the company s center of gr  avity started shifting toward Texas  and shortly after that  Ken Lay was ru  nning a new company called Enron   Over time it became clear that Lay had a   better vision of the future   says one person associated with Enron at tha  t time   He never fought change  He embraced change    Lay had won  but what exactly did that mean  Enron was saddled with massive   debt from the takeover attempt  and thanks to deregulation  no longer had   exclusive use of its pipelines  Without new ideas for that matter  a whole   new business plan the company could be finished before it really even got s  tarted  20  LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES  Jeff Skilling ha  d spent a lot of time in the Midwest  and he was self made at fourteen he h  ad been the chief production director at a start up TV station in Aurora  I  llinois   His mother would drop him off there every day after school    I l  iked being successful when I was working  and I was smart   he told Busines  sWeek earlier this year  But unlike many of his Enron colleagues  Skilling   wasn t deliberate and soft spoken and happy to go home at five o clock  he   was anxious and excitable  and nothing  but nothing excited him more than w  hat he would come to call  intellectual capital   He loved being smart  and   he loved being surrounded by smart people  He graduated from Southern Meth  odist University  went into banking assets and liability management and too  k on Harvard Business School  where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi  s class  Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new  souped   up path to American success  He joined Manhattan s McKinsey and Company as   a business consultant  and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985  20  It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless    and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company  Skilling was above   all an expert at markets and how they worked  While everyone else was worr  ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry  he al  one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses  And so in a world w  here credit was nearly impossible to come by  Skilling came up with what he   called the Gas Bank  which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th  e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers  Enron would not be   a broker but a banker  It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the   risk involved  And Enron would make money on transactions  much like an inv  estment bank would   Skilling worked up some numbers and found them  absolutely compelling   The  n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec  utives  He had a one page presentation   Almost to a person   Skilling says     they thought it was stupid   Almost  After Skilling left the meeting dej  ected  he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized  Lay listened and th  en said   Let s go    The Gas Bank was not an overnight success  For months Skilling woke up in a   cold sweat  sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze  ns of colleagues who had assisted him  In fact  he had come upon one of tho  se divides that seem to define his life   I believed this whole world would   be different  a huge breakthrough  is the way Skilling puts it today  and   even if he is typically immodest  he was right  Fairly soon after launching    the company sold  800 million worth of gas in a week  True to Skilling s   character  success turned out to be a matter of old versus new  He says the   joke around Enron was that if a company s CEO was under fifty   We were in     And he was in too  In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr  on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation  a new division created just fo  r him  In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned  11 million in profit    After that  says Skilling   we never looked back    Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn t work unless it ha  d a trading component  Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w  ould make the project go  But by buying and selling enormous quantities of   gas  Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin  ate it  The company had the best contacts  the best intelligence  and the b  est access to supplies  That  in turn  attracted more customers who wanted   to be part of the play  With so many customers in its pocket  Enron could b  etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m  ake trades for its own benefit Enron could in effect bet on which way the p  rice of gas would go  as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans  but wi  th startling accuracy  thereby generating profits higher than anyone could   have ever imagined   THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m  ade  He created  within Enron  a new culture to match its new trading busin  ess  The idea was to build a  knowledge based business   which demanded a s  kill set not exactly prized by Enron s employees from the old HNG days  Mos  t were deliberate  cautious  responsible  somewhat defensive people  most o  f them men  of course the kind of people you d expect to find working in an   industry regulated by the federal government  But now the company needed b  older people for its bold new era  that included anyone who wanted to make   money lots of money for themselves and for the company   Enron was going to   create a niche for itself or die   one former executive explains   The peo  ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out  because if they had na  rrow views about other things  they had narrow views about the market   Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people  He wanted the s  martest people from schools like Harvard  Stanford  and maybe  Rice  And be  cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company  he   wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big  gest and best investment banks  like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B  oston  In addition to being smart  Enron people were also supposed to be  a  ggressive   You were right for Enron if you didn t want to wait until you w  ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization  20 You could see what he was looking for on  Super Saturdays  at the Houston h  eadquarters  eight fifty minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee  n the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one   day  They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts  their problem solving a  bility  their passion for hard work  and what at Enron was called  a sense   of urgency   People who scored less than 2 5 were scratched  The shrewdest   candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired  These were t  he types that automatically turned down the company s first offer  knowing   Enron would come back with more  The starting salary was around  80 000  Ma  ybe it wasn t a fortune yet but the signing bonus  about  20 000  was more   than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof  ts being renovated close to downtown   Enron people didn t live in far flun  g suburbs  Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office   For the lucky winners  Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted a  nd talented program  New associates learned the latest techniques for struc  turing energy deals  and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g  lobe  The hours were long  but every possible need was taken care of  A com  pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn t be bothered   with  picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions  shining shoes  cleaning th  e house  planning a vacation  Of course  a lot of people who worked for Enr  on never got to take vacations they were too busy making money but they cou  ld use the company gym and the company s personal trainers  If they were ov  erweight or wanted to quit smoking  they could join Enron s Wellness Progra  m  Massages were offered six days a week  from seven in the morning until t  en at night   They were so cutting edge   rhapsodizes someone involved with   the company health care program at the time   They really thought about th  e psychology and what it took to keep these people going   Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms analysts    associates  directors  and managing directors but everyone knew that thos  e titles didn t really matter  Money did  Instead of competitive salaries a  nd decent bonuses  Enron offered competitive salaries and merit based bonus  es with no cap   If you really worked hard and delivered results  you could   make a lot of money   says Ken Rice  who stayed with Enron for 21 years un  til resigning recently as the head of the company s faltering broadband div  ision  Or  as the saying goes  you got to eat what you killed  Gas traders   with two or three years of experience could wind up with a  1 million bonus    And the more you produced  the closer you got to Jeff  Real hot dogs join  ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia  Land Cruiser racing in Australia  or

By 1995 Enron had become North America s largest natural gas m  erchant  controlling 20 percent of the market  But at a company where the b  uzzword was  aggressive   that was no place to stop  Skilling and Lay belie  ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business    Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv  ice at lower prices for consumers  and untold profits for Enron   they bega  n barnstorming the country  pressing their case with entrenched power compa  ny presidents  who  with their multimillion dollar salaries and monopoly se  rvice areas  had little incentive to change  and energy regulators  who wer  e somewhat more receptive  thanks in part to Enron s generous lobbying effo  rts   But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling  In 1997 Ken Lay m  ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company  By then    the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar  gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity  The divisio  n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees  and revenues from    2 billion to  7 billion   Mr  Skilling s experience so far with the turmoil   in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track   the New   York Times noted  Everyone would certainly have thought so  Enron and Skill  ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran  sforming another   FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE  Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within     sang the New York Times in 1999   In the staid world of regulated utilitie  s and energy companies  Enron Corp is that gate crashing Elvis   crowed For  tune in 2000  Wall Street was demanding tech size growth on a tech timetabl  e  and Enron  in 2000  obliged with second quarter earnings of  289 million    up 30 percent from the previous year  That year the company seemed to dis  cover a market a minute  Under Skilling  Enron was trading coal  paper  ste  el  and even weather  No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron   client  People drank more in warm weather than cold  so why not buy a hedg  e against the usual winter downturn  But most exciting to the financial world was Enron s entry into high tech c  ommunications  Because of the company s marketing dominance  EnronOnline be  came another overnight success  handling  335 billion in commodity trades o  nline in 2000  Enron  as usual  made its money on the spread between the bi  d price and the asking price  Then there was the broadband business  To Enr  on  trading excess capacity in large  high speed fiber optic networks  empt  y lanes on the fabled information highway  wasn t that different from tradi  ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines  So Enron created a market for wha  t the industry calls bandwidth  Soon after  it also announced a twenty year   deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people   in their homes  Enron looked like a company that couldn t lose   Its strat  egy of building businesses  shedding hard assets  and trading various commo  dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market   BusinessWeek insis  ted  There was  however  another reason Enron did so well in such a short time    the company s hard nosed approach toward its customers  The old notion of c  ustomer service was based on the long haul you had to nurse and coddle cust  omers to keep them  But Enron had new markets and new ideas customers had t  o come to it  Over time  the company stopping referring to its business cli  ents as customers and began calling them  counterparties   Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable  Gains were m  aximized by creating  owning  and then abandoning a market before it became   overtaxed and overregulated  So if you wanted to launch a high risk ventur  e quickly such as Zilkha Energy s new high tech approach to drilling for oi  l you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un  derwrite the project  if it ever would  But because Enron invented its mark  ets and subsequently dominated them  Enron could set the terms of its deals    from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene  d at all  20 While many businesses used what was known in the industry as  mark to marke  t accounting   for instance  Enron used it on an unprecedented scale  The c  ompany priced their deals at current market value but it was always Enron s   idea of the market value  companies that balked at their pricing didn t ge  t deals  And while old fashioned companies spread their profits out like an  nuities over a period of years  Enron took most of its profit up front  How  ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years  they   went on the books in the current year  If a few analysts thought there mig  ht be something fishy about what they called  subjective accounting   inves  tors didn t particularly care as long as the profits rolled in  As the mark  et fluctuated and the landscape changed  the company might abandon a projec  t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren t   going to be high enough   Enron is known for leaving people at the altar     says one former employee  Winning the highest possible profits for the comp  any could even extend to Enron s attitude toward charity  When a fundraiser   for the Houston READ Commission  a literacy group  called on Enron for a c  ontribution  it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron s compe  ting literacy charity   Even the person who was supposed to give money away   for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron   he says  As Enron became more and more successful  the culture Skilling had created   took on a dark side  The competition turned inward  As one member of the En  ron family put it   It became a company full of mercenaries   The change st  arted at the bottom  As Enron s domination of the energy market grew  most   of the recruiting frills fell away  New associates were treated much like t  he commodities the company traded  Global Change s Enron spies reported ove  rhearing orders like  I need a smart person go buy me one  or  Buy me an in  telligent slave  quick   Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl  e sang to you on your birthday  but now the workaholism bordered on self pa  rody  A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months  It was to  o disruptive  People couldn t get their work done  And  of course  Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension    The Performance Review Committee  which had initially been installed by S  killing in the Capital group  became known as the harshest forced ranking s  ystem in the country  Employees were rated on a scale of one to five  and t  hose with fives were usually gone within six months   The PRC s nickname qu  ickly became  rank and yank    It was a point of pride that Skilling s divi  sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year  As one Skilling assoc  iate put it   Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery   store   Skilling s approach to business get in and get out had become Enro  n s attitude toward its workers  In time  it would become many workers  att  itude toward the company  Teamwork  never that valuable in a trading cultur  e  went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus  If protocol required an Enr  on higher up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World    he might help or he might not  depending on whether another  potentially m  ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere  Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed     They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s  ight of the future   says one former employee  Anyone who couldn t close de  als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores  as were the higher u  ps who had backed them  Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte  n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase  No old tapes  became a  n Enron clich    People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight   says   one former Enron executive  In such a hothouse  paranoia flowered  New contracts contained highly restr  ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company    E mail was monitored  A former executive routinely carried two laptops  on  e for the company and one for himself  People may have been rich at Enron    but they weren t necessarily happy  One recruiter described the culture thi  s way   They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y  ou bleed to death   BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world s leading energy   company into the world s leading company  he had to make one more change  J  ust as he had done ten years before  Skilling had to purge the company of i  ts remaining old order  Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea  lt with tangible assets like pipelines  it now valued bold executives who d  ealt with intangible assets  Pipelines  power plants they may have been Enr  on s pride  but Skilling wanted them gone  Expensive  long term building pr  ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm  ous returns on investment capital  and Skilling knew it   It wasn t the tim  e for long term approaches   an Enron executive says of Wall Street s mood     It was the technology era   To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past  Skilling had to take on Rebe  cca Mark  long considered his rival for the CEO s job  Mark was for many ye  ars the poster child for the Enron way  Young  attractive  aggressive her n  ickname was Mark the Shark she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th  e requisite Harvard MBA  Mark was largely responsible for the success of En  ron International  the asset heavy side of the company where she developed    20 billion worth of gas and power plants  which accounted for 40 percent o  f Enron s profits in 1998  For this she reaped breathtaking compensation on  e Enron executive estimated  10 million and adoring press clips  including   two appearances on Fortune s list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo  rate America  But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas fired power plant in Dabhol  Indi  a  one of the largest ever constructed  She had played the game the Enron w  ay  Taking Enron into a new market  she had finagled low import taxes  20 p  ercent instead of the usual 53  and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c  hanges in government  But the time and expense needed to make India and oth  er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron s goals    and Skilling s impatience with Mark grew  Forcing Mark out  however  was no easy matter  Key executives left  divisio  ns were dismantled  but she remained  The truth was Enron didn t mind firin  g lower level employees  but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive  relen  tless people it tended to promote  The company preferred humiliation keepin  g a director in his cubicle  say  but failing to include him in the glamour   deals  or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title   One particularly d  ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school  gratis   A company a  s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most   visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public relations disa  ster  So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian  They gave Mar  k her own company  Despite Skilling s contempt for asset heavy businesses    Enron spent more than  2 billion to buy a run of the mill British water uti  lity that could serve as Enron s entry into the emerging world of water pri  vatization  Mark was put in charge of making Enron  yes  the world s greate  st water company  Azurix  as the new business was called  looked like anoth  er sure thing  Its IPO in 1999 raised  695 million  20 But Mark had to succeed on Enron s increasingly abbreviated timetable in a   business fraught with political and emotional complexities  Water is not li  ke gas or electricity owners and governments are a lot less willing to give   it up  even for lots of money  The company stumbled  layoffs commenced  an  d confidence evaporated  By August 2000 the stock price  which had started   out at  19  had fallen to  5  Mark s resignation followed  and Azurix  much   diminished  was folded into Enron   I think it s best for Rebecca to start   afresh   Lay  who had been a mentor to Mark  told the Wall Street Journal    Or as one critic put it   They were more interested in destroying the old   culture than running a business   20 As 2000 drew to a close  Skilling was in total command  In December Ken Lay   announced the inevitable   The best time for the succession to occur is wh  en the company is doing well   he told the press   Enron is doing extremely   well now   In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO s job  ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED  Enron s domination of the electric   power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac  le  Both PBS s Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron  portraying t  he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington  L  ay and Enron s political action committee are the top contributors to Georg  e W  Bush  to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo  od or electricity  Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent   anthems to the free market  while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of   the company s jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif  ornia  as both tried to buy power online  The Times reported that Lay had t  ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d  eregulation  The bad press was  to say the least  ironic  Just as the media   was pounding Enron for its omnipotence  Wall Street was discovering its we  aknesses  By late March the stock price had slid to  50 a share from  80 in   January  Within Enron  the asset based divisions took the rap for the decline   The   India plant continued to be enormously costly  at least in part because of   constant turnover within Enron s management team   But the California situa  tion was more visible and therefore more damaging  despite Enron s claim th  at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population   and never properly managed those it had   For three months Gray Davis did a   very good job of blaming us   says Mark Palmer  a vice president for corpo  rate communications   We were a Texas company  There was a Texan in the Whi  te House  California was a state that didn t put him in office  and his big  gest contributor was a Texas energy company  Performance is going to take c  are of our stock price  The truth will take care of Gray Davis    Californi  a utilities still owe Enron  500 million  another reason stockholders might   be panicky   But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling s al  l too apparent lack of contrition  Facing down his critics  he cracked a jo  ke comparing California with the Titanic    At least the Titanic went down   with its lights on    But the biggest problem was Enron s telecommunications division  which had   been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price  Investors   believed that Enron could revolutionize high speed communications  just as   it had revolutionized gas and power  Enron estimated the global market for   buying and selling space over fiber optic cable would grow from  155 billi  on in 2001 to  383 billion by 2004 but then the tech bubble burst  So too d  id the much hyped movies on demand deal with Blockbuster  For the first tim  e in its confoundingly successful life  Enron had nothing new to take to ma  rket  Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds    Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street  Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron s most important cheerleaders  t  he stock analysts  in the tent  but he wasn t cut out to be a supplicant  D  uring the reporting of first quarter profits  he called an analyst who chal  lenged Enron s financial reporting an  asshole   When the company reported   hefty second quarter profits  many analysts questioned whether those profit  s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse  ts  Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron s accounting  Skilling pr  omised  as he always had  that innovations were just around the corner   Th  ere wasn t any positive news   Carol Coale  of Prudential Financial  says n  ow   Basically  he talked me out of a downgrade   The business press  so generous in the past  turned surly  Fortune had aske  d in March whether Enron was overpriced    Start with a pretty straightforw  ard question  How exactly does Enron make its money    The routine cashing   in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray  ed in the media as a fire sale   Skilling had sold  33 million worth  Ken L  ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount   Then the Wall Street Jour  nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with  in the company   It was essentially risk management against Enron s possibl  e failures   Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th  e stock price  By late August it had fallen below  40  Enron  so institutio  nally unforgiving  finally got a taste of its own medicine   When Wall Stre  et is in love with a stock  they re forgiving of something like accounting     says Carol Coale   When a company falls out of favor  all these issues ca  rry more weight   This fact was not lost on people inside the company  who suddenly started e  xperiencing an attack of conscience  Those who had looked the other way as   the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec  retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th  eir ways   It just created an attitude   one executive still at Enron says     If senior people are doing that  why are we held to a higher standard  Th  ere was a real culture of  We re above everyone else    20 Loyalty had never been prized at Enron  so there was no reason to expect it   now  An old fashioned  slow moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi  p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road   But   as   one Houston oilman explains   if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit  h someone who doesn t have loyalty and has money  then you have a corporati  on that s better suited for good times than bad   As it turned out  that description applied to Jeff Skilling too  As the sto  ck price stubbornly refused to ascend  he made no secret of his unhappiness   and frustration  Then  after a trip to visit the families of three employe  es killed at a plant in England  he had an epiphany  Life was short  for hi  m  Enron was over  Ever stoic  Ken Lay returned to the CEO s office  named   a new president  arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors    and promised a kinder  gentler Enron in the future  Trading anything and   everything was out  The company  Lay says  will still innovate but  innovat  e much closer to our core   As for the culture   Things like the Performanc  e Review Committee  I think we could have applied better  By trying to cate  gorize people into so many different categories  you ended up creating a mo  rale problem   That Skilling s supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news   of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to   their lack of emotional intelligence  Despite Skilling s lengthy tenure wi  th Enron  he d always been contemptuous of the long haul  he d always belie  ved in cutting losses and moving on  But now that he was abandoning them wh  en the company was in trouble  it was different   Even Jeff s biggest detra  ctors wouldn t have wanted him to walk out the door   one loyalist admits  But on the day we meet  Skilling is looking forward  not back   Look   he s  ays with finality   ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron  Were my int  erests aligned with the shareholders  Absolutely   Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures  he is nestling hims  elf back into the world of ideas  His eyes flash as he talks about new tech  nologies   The first wave never gets it right   he says   The stand alone d  ot coms didn t work  but the technological applications will create a secon  d wave that will change the world   Houston  he promises  will become the w  orld s center of commodity trading  and he intends to be a part of it  In f  act  he is already shopping for office space   This is the second wave  and Enron s got it   he says  almost breathless     There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g  et it      Enron Fails to Smooth Things Over By Peter Eavis  mailto peavis thestreet com  Senior Columnist TheStreet com 10 23 2001 01 07 PM EDT URL   http   www thestreet com markets detox 10002864 html   Enron  ENE NYSE   news   commentary  held a special conference call Tuesday   to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock  20 But worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and   the CEO publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off balance   sheet transaction  20 The transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex   financing that Enron entered into with a partnership called LJM2  which wa  s led by Enron s finance chief Andrew Fastow  Terminating this arrangement   led to a  1 2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter  Monday  Enron   stock plunged 20  after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commis  sion is probing  related party transactions   Executives declined to respon  d to questions about Fastow s role in the LJM2 partnership on the Tuesday c  all  20 Another key issue is the impact of the equity reduction  The company said o  n the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth q  uarter  due to the termination of the LJM2 financing  But CEO Ken Lay said   the company wouldn t be increasing its earnings guidance of  1 80 a share f  or 2001 and  2 15 for 2002  20 When a share count drops  earnings per share should normally increase  assu  ming the earnings number stays constant  The 60 million shares are equivale  nt to about 6 5  of the company s diluted total in the third quarter  As a   result  Enron should have raised its per share profits forecast by about th  at much  assuming constant earnings  20 When asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing    CEO Lay replied that the company had previously increased its guidance for   this year  He then affirmed the 2002 number  20 Now  to be fair  Enron may not be forecasting lower earnings  The planned r  eduction in shares may simply bring the total share count back close to a l  evel in the fourth quarter and 2002 that analysts had originally expected    Notably  the share count in the third quarter jumped by 20 million  meaning   a fourth quarter reduction might not change matters that much  Alternative  ly  Enron may beat fourth quarter estimates by 6 5   perhaps the company ha  s simply chosen not to increase guidance at this stage  given uncertainties   in the economy  In any case  more clarity on this matter is clearly needed    20 Calls to Enron weren t immediately returned  The stock edged up 2  Tuesday   after falling nearly 40  since last week amid worries about complex off bal  ance sheet deals  20 The call  arranged after Enron s Monday plunge  contained a lot of queries   about two trusts  called Marlin II and Whitewing  against which Enron borro  wed some  3 4 billion  Lay became testy after questioning by Richard Grubma  n of Boston based hedge fund Highfields Capital Management  Grubman  who wa  s called an  a  hole  by Enron s former CEO Jeff Skilling on an April confe  rence call  was trying to find out the value of water assets held by Marlin   II  The optimal way of paying back money borrowed through the trust is to   sell the water assets  20 Grubman s line of questioning implied that the Marlin assets were worth onl  y about  100 million  meaning Enron would have to find about  900 million t  o pay off the Marlin II related debt  Grubman arrived at  100 million after   factoring in what he saw as the effects of a third quarter writedown to wa  ter assets  some of which are included in Marlin II  20 Lay disputed the  100 million number  At one point  he accused Grubman of d  riving Enron s stock down and monopolizing the Tuesday conference call  In   the middle of Grubman s comments  Lay told the call operator to go to the n  ext caller  20 Grubman didn t immediately return a call seeking comment  20 If Enron has to find  900 million  this can be done by issuing stock or rai  sing cash on its balance sheet  If the latter route is taken  Enron says it   s likely to use asset sales to generate the cash  Enron executives said li  quidity would be sufficient and detailed at least  3 35 billion in availabl  e credit lines  20 But if Enron s debt to capital ratio exceeds 65   the covenants on some of   those lines are broken  After the  1 2 billion equity writedown and other c  harges taken in the third quarter  that ratio is probably about 50  55   En  ron hasn t released a third quarter balance sheet to arrive at an exact cal  culation   It would take  3 billion in further writedowns or charges to pus  h Enron s debt to capital ratio up to 65   20  Stocks 20 More Static For Enron 20 Forbes com staff  Forbes com 10 23 01  11 15 AM ET 20  NEW YORK   Enron scrambled again to reassure

paragraph         Houston  Oct  8  Bloomberg     Enron Corp  agreed to sell Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas Co  for  2 9 billion in cash  stock and assumed debt  ending a more than two year effort to shed its Oregon utility       Enron  the largest energy trader  no longer needs Portland General to sell electricity in the West and wants to spend on more promising businesses  Chief Executive Ken Lay said in a statement  Enron bought the utility for  3 21 billion in 1997 to gain knowledge on selling power to neighboring California          Portland General is a 5 percent bottom line growth rate company    said Anatol Feygin  a J P  Morgan analyst who rates Enron   buy      On wholesale and retail energy operations  Enron has had 35 percent growth in earnings before interest and taxes  and bottom line growth of just under 20 percent          Shares of Enron rose  1 72  or 5 4 percent  to  33 45  Northwest fell 42 cents to  22 99        Enron will get less than it hoped from the sale  though spokeswoman Karen Denne said the Houston based company expects to break even        A November 1999 agreement to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources of Nevada for  3 1 billion fell through in April of this year because California banned sales of power plants serving the state        Regulators had required Sierra Pacific to sell a stake in a plant that sells power to California as a condition of its purchase of Portland General                             Oregon Regulators       Both Northwest and Portland General are based in Portland  Oregon  which should make it easier for Enron to win clearance of the sale  Oregon regulators can be expected to approve the purchase in as little as nine months  Northwest Chief Executive Richard Reiten said          No other combination of companies could achieve as much political  regulatory  and general support of the citizens    Reiten said    We operate in essentially the same geographic area          Northwest  a gas utility  will pay  1 55 billion in cash   200 million in preferred stock and  50 million in common stock  Enron said  Northwest will assume  1 1 billion in debt and give  75 million in customer discounts previously agreed upon by Enron       Northwest has 525 000 natural gas customers in Oregon and Washington  Portland General has 730 000 customers in Oregon       Over the past 10 years  Lay has transformed Enron from a gas pipeline operator into a company that gets most of its profit growth from commodities trading        Enron no longer wants to own expensive assets such as power plants that are under the control of regulators  who limit profitability and often make the assets difficult to sell  analysts say          This is a sign Ken Lay is tightening up the ship    said Mark Baskir  manager of the  15 million Strong Energy Fund  which holds 2 400 Enron shares    I feel better about the stock now                                Retail Sales       Enron s road to becoming a top energy trader in California has been bumpy  It delayed attempts to sell electricity to California residential customers in 1999  saying the state s deregulation law made it impossible to profit from small power sales  It transferred its retail electricity sales business in all states to NewPower Holdings Inc   a separately traded company formed by Enron in October 2000        When power prices in western state s soared late last year and early this year  some utilities stopped paying for wholesale power  Enron has estimated it s owed as much as  500 million for energy sales in California        California s two largest utilities  PG E Corp  s Pacific Gas   Electric and Edison International s Southern California Edison  are insolvent after racking up billions in debt buying power at prices far exceeding what state officials would allow them to pass to customers                            California Battle       California officials have accused Enron and other power traders of manipulating the state s market  Enron also has struggled with Oregon regulators        It was forced to cut power prices to Portland General s customers by  141 million over eight years  more than double what the company had anticipated when it bought the utility  Oregon also rejected Enron s plans to sell its utility s 14 generating plants       Enron will keep its stake in Northwest for at least 30 months  the company said in a statement  It will have voting rights limited to 4 9 percent of Northwest s common stock and will have representation on Northwest s board       Northwest said the sale is expected to close this quarter and add to earnings next year  Northwest expects to maintain its annual dividend of  1 25 a share through this year       Job cuts are planned  Northwest said  without saying how many positions would be eliminated  Northwest said it won t renegotiate union contracts       Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston will arrange loans to finance the cash portion of the purchase  Northwest said  Credit Suisse advised Enron on the sale        Enron last week agreed to sell oil and gas fields in India to the U K  s BG Group Plc for  388 million  In May  the company withdrew from a gas pipeline project in Qatar    Northwest Natural Gas to buy Portland General for  1 8 billion By WILLIAM McCALL AP Business Writer  10 08 2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001  The Associated Press  All Rights Reserved   PORTLAND  Ore   AP    Northwest Natural Gas said Monday it will buy Portland General Electric for  1 8 billion in a deal that will combine the largest natural gas and electric utilities in Oregon   The purchase comes about four years after Enron Corp   one of the largest energy companies in the nation  paid  3 2 billion for Portland General Electric in a bid to expand into the Pacific Northwest and California  But the slow pace of deregulation in Oregon and the California energy crisis prompted Houston based Enron to start shopping for another buyer shortly after the takeover   Northwest Natural Gas said it expects to close the purchase late next year  pending approval by regulators and its shareholders   Enron will receive  1 55 billion cash and  350 million in securities   The deal will create a Portland based holding company with  5 billion in assets and more than 1 25 million customers  The new company would own more than 2 000 megawatts of generation  26 000 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines and 12 000 miles of gas mains   Northwest Natural Gas Chairman Richard G  Reiten said the deal would  help ensure that assets critical to Oregon s economy and environment will be locally owned    There will be an undetermined number of job cuts  he said  although all union contracts will be honored   The deal brought immediate criticism from one of the state s leading consumer watchdog groups   Bob Jenks  executive director of the Citizens Utility Board  said he was concerned about the heavy debt Northwest Natural Gas will carry under the deal and the gas company s recent efforts to lobby the Legislature to bypass regulators    They ve tried to politicize rate proceedings   Jenks said   If that s going to happen  and PGE rate cases are fought out in the Legislature and the governor s office  then I don t think that s going to be in the interest of PGE customers    Analysts said the deal makes sense because the two utilities can cut a lot of costs in their overlapping service areas   But Dan Fidell of A G  Edwards   Sons said analysts and investors also are wary of the heavy debt load on NW Natural    Their balance sheet is going to suffer  at least in the near term   Fidell said   They re probably looking at downgrades in their credit rating    Enron earlier attempt to sell Portland General Eelctric fell through last March  It has seen stock prices fall in recent months as it moved into investments outside its core business  including an Internet company that took a beating in the stock market  But in morning trading Monday  Enron shares rose 77 cents to  32 50  which analysts said was partly due to heavier investment in strategic energy companies

YORK  Oct 8  Reuters    Northwest Natural Gas Co  said on Monday that the acquisition of Portland General Electric from Enron Corp would enhance its earnings by  double digits  from the first year

Jones   Northwest Natural Gas Co  s  NWN   planned acquisition of Enron Corp  s  ENE  Portland General Electric Co  unit doesn t contain a provision for a breakup fee  Northwest officials said Monday during a conference call    Earlier  Northwest Natural  of Portland  Ore   and Enron  of Houston  announced the companies agreed to the terms of the sale  The transaction was anticipated since Friday when the companies confirmed a Wall Street Journal that the two were talking  Under the terms of the planned sale  Northwest will acquire the Enron unit for  1 55 billion in cash and  250 million in seller financing securities  Northwest also agreed to cancel a  75 million payment obligation from Enron to Portland General that was related to Enron s purchase of Portland General in 1996   Northwest also is assuming  1 1 billion in existing Portland General debt and preferred stock   During the conference call  Northwest officials said they expect the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter of 2002  following approval of Northwest s shareholders and regulatory agencies  including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission   The company has already secured the necessary financing  officials said   Northwest shares recently traded at  23 10  down 31 cents  or 1 3  On Friday  the stock closed down 9 9  to  23 41 in anticipation of the acquisition   Enron shares  meanwhile  have gained  1 41  or 4 4   to  33 14   Enron had previously agreed to sell Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources  SRP  for  3 1 billion  but the deal was called off six months ago  in part because of complications stemming from the California power crisis   Enron s decision to sell Portland  an electric utility with  5 billion in assets and  3 9 billion in enterprise value  is an example of Enron s strategy to sell its physical assets and focus on its energy trading activities    Northwest Natural Gas Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Reiten said the acquisition of Portland General will have  solid accretion  under old accounting rules  and  double digit accretion  under the new accounting rules pertaining to the treatment of goodwill  Under the former accounting rules  goodwill was amortized to expense   Reiten didn t provide any specific estimates for the earnings of the combined companies   In an interview  Reiten said the ability of the transaction to increase the combined company s earnings potential will be helped by a number of factors including the companies  overlapping service areas and combined customer bases   Reiten expects to consolidate customer billing  call centers and meter reading   Prior attempts by Northwest and Portland General to initiate joint meter reading for about 350 000 customers already have yielded about  1 million in cost savings  Reiten said   Also  the acquisition gives Northwest the ability for non speculative trading around the combined company s natural gas and electric assets  he added    The opportunities are exceptional for a utility in the Northwest  That s why we are so confident about the ability of this transaction to add to the bottom line   said Reiten  who served between 1989 and 1996 as the company s president and chief operating officer and as a member of its board   The combination will result in staff reductions  but Reiten said he couldn t quantify how many  He said some of the reductions would occur through early retirement incentives and though attrition    Christina Cheddar  Dow Jones Newswires  201 938 5166  christina cheddar dowjones com  Copyright   2000 Dow Jones

Enron Dealings With Partnerships Recently Run by F  astow By Rebecca Smith and John R  Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal  10 23 2001 The Wall Street Journal A3  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    Enron Corp  said it has been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commi  ssion seeking information on the energy giant s controversial dealings with   partnerships that were set up and run until recently by its chief financia  l officer  Andrew S  Fastow  20 Following Enron s announcement yesterday morning of the SEC inquiry  the co  mpany s stock took another big slide  falling more than 20  in New York Sto  ck Exchange trading  As of 4 p m   Enron shares were trading at  20 65  off    5 40  knocking about  4 billion off Enron s market capitalization  Volume   topped the Big Board s most active list at about 36 million shares  A week   ago  Enron stock was trading at about  33 a share  Subsequently  the compa  ny announced a  1 01 billion third quarter write off that produced a  618 m  illion loss  Analysts also voiced concerns yesterday about possible other bad news lurki  ng amid Enron s vast and extremely complex operations  The company has deal  ings with a number of related entities  Under certain circumstances  if Enr  on s credit rating and stock price fall far enough  the company would be ob  ligated to issue tens of millions of additional shares to these entities  d  iluting the holdings of current shareholders  20 Enron has previously acknowledged the provisions but said its business is s  trong and it feels confident that there will be no defaults  20 In a statement  Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the com  pany  will cooperate fully  with the SEC inquiry and  look s  forward to th  e opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest   Enron h  as consistently said that it believes its dealings with the Fastow related   partnerships were proper and properly disclosed  The company has said it pu  t billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership related transact  ions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions  20 The SEC inquiry came from the agency s Fort Worth  Texas  regional office    According to a person familiar with the matter  this would indicate that th  e inquiry comes from the SEC s enforcement arm  as opposed to its corporate   finance section  The participation of the enforcement branch would indicat  e that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of   securities law  However  enforcement branch inquiries often don t produce   any allegations of wrongdoing  It also appears that the SEC hasn t yet take  n the step of launching a formal investigation  which would be a sign that   the agency believes securities laws might have been violated  The SEC decli  ned to comment  20 Certainly  there have been questions and concerns about those partnership t  ransactions  which contributed to a  1 2 billion reduction in shareholder e  quity last week as part of Enron s efforts to unwind the deals  Mr  Fastow    who has declined repeated interview requests  resigned from the partnershi  ps  known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co Investment LP  in late July in the f  ace of rising conflict of interest concerns by Wall Street analysts and maj  or company investors  20 Since then  internal partnership documents have shown that Mr  Fastow and p  erhaps a handful of Enron associates made millions of dollars last year in   fees and capital increases as general partner of the LJM2  the larger of th  e two partnerships  20 Mr  Fastow s partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside Enron    according to people familiar with the matter  For instance  these people sa  y  sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999  Enron Treasurer   Jeffrey McMahon went to company president Jeffrey Skilling and complained   about potential conflicts of interest posed by Mr  Fastow s activities  Mr    Skilling didn t share Mr  McMahon s concern  these people say  and Mr  McM  ahon requested and received reassignment to another post  20 Mr  Skilling resigned as Enron president and chief executive in mid August    citing personal reasons and the fall in Enron s stock price  which peaked   at about  90 a share last year  Mr  McMahon and Mr  Skilling haven t respon  ded to repeated interview requests  20 Investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in Enron s de  alings with other related entities  In some cases  Enron could be required   to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if c  ertain so called double trigger provisions occur  20 For example  last July Enron helped create the Marlin Water Trust II  which   sold  915 million in notes that are due July 15  2003  However  Enron can   be considered in default  in advance of that date  if its stock price falls   below  34 13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to b  elow investment grade by either Moody s Investors Service or Standard   Poo  r s  20 Currently  Enron debt is still investment grade at both ratings agencies an  d would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment   grade category  Last week  Moody s put Enron on review for a possible downg  rade  However  observers believe that even if Moody s lowers Enron s rating    the company will still be investment grade   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved   09  October 23  2001 Where Did the Value Go at Enron  By FLOYD NORRIS New York Times What really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders e  ver seen  Wall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron  news quote   redirect   marketwatch redirect ctx MW 3Dhttp   custom marketwatch com custom nyt com   html companyprofile asp symb 3DENE   released its quarterly earnings a week   ago  Yesterday shares in Enron plunged  5 40  to  20 65  after the company   said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the tran  sactions  The reaction was in some ways puzzling  Given the questions that have been   raised since the earnings announcement   some of them prominently featured   in The Wall Street Journal   it was likely that the S E C  would begin a pr  eliminary inquiry  Whether it will go farther than that is not clear  but if nothing else the   slide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confron  t a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet valu  e to dribble out  Enron s shares rose 67 cents  to  33 84  last Tuesday  as   investors first reacted to the earnings announcement  But since then they   have fallen  13 19  or 39 percent  The  1 2 billion reduction in shareholders  equity was not mentioned in a n  ews release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday  It was bri  efly mentioned in a conference call with analysts  but many of the listener  s seem to have not noticed that  wrongly thinking Kenneth L  Lay  Enron s c  hairman and chief executive  was referring to a  1 billion write off that w  as disclosed in the earnings release  When questions were asked in the following days  the explanations were less   than thorough  Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders  equity   was related to the termination of  structured finance vehicles  involving p  artnerships that had been controlled by the company s chief financial offic  er   Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how   the company goes about its business   said Ralph Pellecchia  a credit anal  yst at Fitch Investors Service  He added that the issue of the company s  c  redibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its o  wn   Enron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its   financial reports  But last night it said Mr  Lay would hold another confe  rence call with investors at 9 30 a m  today  20 The company s earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many a  nalysts  They referred to such things as  share settled costless collar arr  angements  and  derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent natu  re of existing restricted forward contracts   The disclosures said the comp  any entered into the transactions  to hedge certain merchant investments an  d other assets   It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them  even though the   underlying assets included investments that declined in value  The Wall St  reet Journal  citing reports the partnerships made to institutional investo  rs  has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash distri  butions to their investors  Enron officials in recent days have refused to   discuss the arrangements in any detail  One of the questions that the S E C  may look into is whether the terminati  on of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item    or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earni  ngs  An S E C  spokesman declined to comment  Under accounting rules  a company s transactions in its own shares cannot p  roduce profits or losses  whatever the effect on cash flow  So a company th  at sells its shares for  10 each  and buys them back at  50  or at  1  will   report no earnings effect  Enron said that the reduction to shareholders e  quity  and a related reduction in notes receivable   is the result of Enron   s termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver En  ron shares in future periods   Stephen Moore  an analyst with Moody s Investors Service who has put Enron   s debt on review for a possible downgrade  said that while some of the deta  ils were not clear   Essentially  Enron s promise was that a certain amount   of Enron s shares would be worth  1 billion  The shares plummeted  and the  y were not  worth that much  Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings  which leaves out some expense  s  and directs attention away from its balance sheet  which is disclosed on  ly in S E C  filings  not in the earnings news release  The reduction in sh  areholders  equity would be shown only on the third quarter balance sheet    which has yet to be released  Earlier this year  Jeffrey Skilling  then Enron s chief executive  reacted   strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to p  rovide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released  He called the que  stioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners  Mr  Skilling late  r resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr  Lay  the chairman   and former chief executive  took back the latter title  While Enron was riding high  its often difficult to understand reports were   generally seen as not being a problem  The company appeared to be the domi  nant force in the business of energy trading  and to be able to produce phe  nomenal profits  When Mr  Lay was reported as having played an important ro  le in formulating the Bush administration s energy policies  the aura was o  nly enhanced  In January  the shares traded for  84  But now  with some of the company s ventures clearly having run into proble  ms  it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the compan  y s reports  That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all was be  cause of the involvement of the chief financial officer  and some have wond  ered if there might have been similar deals with others  Mr  Lay has promised to make the company s financial reports easier to unde  rstand  and last week s report was at first praised by some analysts for do  ing just that  In a news release yesterday  Mr  Lay said the company welcomed the S E C  s   request for information   We will cooperate fully with the S E C  and look   forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to   rest   he said   FRONT PAGE   FIRST SECTION  SEC probes Enron over financial dealings 20 Financial Times  Oct 23  2001 By JULIE EARLE  JOHN LABATE and SHEILA MCNULTY  Enron  the US energy giant  disclosed yesterday that the Securities and Exc  hange Commission had asked it to provide financial information at the start   of an informal inquiry  20 The announcement follows a rapid sell off in the stock in reaction to Enron   s surprise revelation last week of a Dollars 1 2bn charge to equity to eli  minate the dilutive effects of closing one of its controversial financing v  ehicles  20 In revealing the SEC call for more detailed information  regarding certain   related party transactions   Enron hopes to counter growing criticism that   it should be more transparent   We welcome this request   said Kenneth Lay    Enron chairman and chief executive officer   We will co operate fully with   the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these   transactions to rest   20 The SEC probe into Enron s financial dealings is an informal one at this st  age  according to the company  and the request for documents is voluntary    However  SEC probes often begin lightly as investigators gather information   on an issue  20 Such a probe could turn into a formal investigation at any time  In that ca  se  regulators would be armed with subpoena powers and could demand certain   documents be handed over  The SEC would not confirm or deny the existence   of the Enron probe  20 Mr Lay did not say which transactions the SEC was reviewing  although analy  sts believe they relate to Andrew Fastow  Enron chief financial officer  wh  o has been reported to have run a limited partnership that bought assets va  lued at hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron  20 Analysts say the transactions  while controversial because of Mr Fastow s l  inks to the company  have been disclosed  What concerns them  however  is h  ow Enron

is the most complicated of earnings reports  20 The UBS Warburg analyst was  nevertheless  as ill prepared as his peers for   the announcement of a Dollars 1 2bn charge to equity to eliminate the dilu  tive effects of closing one of its controversial financing vehicles  20 The news overshadowed Enron s on target 26 per cent increase in third quart  er earnings per share  sending the stock plunging  20 The Securities and Exchange Commission s subsequent request for more inform  ation about Enron s financial activities has reinforced analyst perceptions   that the company should have been more transparent in its reporting  20 Curt Launer  of Credit Suisse First Boston  says expectations for more disc  losure had built up over the past two months  Kenneth Lay  Enron chairman    had promised to be more forthcoming when he resumed the duties of chief exe  cutive following the resignation of Jeff Skilling in August  20 While Mr Lay did improve Enron s disclosure by creating headings for new bu  siness segments and providing more detail within each of them  the Dollars   1 2bn charge still caught the market off guard  20  It came as a surprise to us   said Stephen Moore  of Moody s Investors Ser  vice   We should have been informed that it was there   20 Mr Barone found it disturbing that Enron disclosed the charge in  a fleetin  g comment  during its conference call with analysts and did not mention it   in its nine page news release  20  Despite progress in other areas  there appears to be much more work ahead   before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the   past are fully resolved   he said  20 Enron contends that  we did disclose it in the conference call  and it was   one of the first points raised in the Q and A session  on the conference ca  ll    20 Mr Lay has pledged to co operate with the SEC s request  which appears to b  e part of an informal inquiry rather than an official investigation  In the   meantime  he adds  Enron will focus on its core businesses  20 That is something analysts say Enron has strayed too far away from  Ray Nil  es of Salomon Smith Barney says the company s core franchise   its wholesal  e

believes th  ere is potential for more write offs  20 Enron is embroiled in a legal dispute with an Indian state electricity boar  d over a power project and is one of several energy traders facing question  s in California over accusations of a manipulation of power prices   a char  ge it denies  20 Analysts say its UK businesses are not seeing big multiples  and Enron says   it only expects to take Dollars 200m in  goodwill  versus Dollars 5 7bn on   its books  20 Copyright  The Financial Times Limited   Enron Discloses SEC Inquiry 20 Information Request Involves Ties to Money Losing Partnerships 20 Washington Post By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday  October 23  2001  Page E03 20 Enron Corp  shares sank more than 20 percent yesterday after the Houston en  ergy company disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission request for inf  ormation about Enron s ties to outside investment partnerships set up by th  e company s chief financial officer  The SEC would not comment on its action  which Enron spokesman Mark Palmer   called an  informal inquiry   not an investigation   We welcome this reques  t   said Kenneth L  Lay  chairman and chief executive of the Houston based   company  But the announcement jarred investors  confidence in the giant energy tradi  ng company  already hurt by the unexpected resignation of chief executive J  effrey K  Skilling in August  and heavy losses from investments in broadban  d Internet and other technology ventures   A lot of people threw in the towel today   said Anatol Feygin  an analyst   with J P  Morgan in New York  The SEC request was made privately last Wednesday  the day after Enron repo  rted a  1 billion write off of investment losses and restructuring charges   from unsuccessful technology ventures and other operations  The write offs   left Enron with a  618 million loss in the third quarter  84 cents a share     The Wall Street Journal reported last week that  35 million of the write of  f was tied to losses at limited partnerships established by Enron s chief f  inancial officer  Andrew Fastow  and run by him until July  Enron told investment analysts last week that it had repurchased 55 million   shares of its stock held by the partnerships that Fastow had directed  red  ucing shareholder equity by  1 2 billion  According to the Wall Street Journal  Fastow set up several investment part  nerships with the approval of Enron s board  The partnerships engaged in bi  llions of dollars in complex financial transactions involving Enron and mad  e major investments in power plants and other assets alongside Enron  An Enron shareholder has filed suit in Texas state court alleging that Enro  n s board violated its duty to the company by permitting the chief financia  l officer to engage in the outside transactions that allegedly earned milli  ons of dollars in fees for himself and other investors in the partnerships    What Enron received from the relationships is not clear  Feygin said that the company had informed analysts about the limited partne  rships  which offered Enron a way to take positions in strategic but uncert  ain technology ventures without detailing the outcomes in its public financ  ial statements  20  In hindsight  that was an error in judgment  I don t think it was an error   in principle   the analyst said  Enron could have revealed the SEC inquiry last week but did not disclose it   until yesterday  and for many investors  that was the last straw  Feygin s  aid  The stock closed yesterday at  20 65  down  5 40  as 36 million shares chan

the company discl  osed federal securities regulators asked for details on investment partners  hips formerly run by its chief financial officer  20 The request covers transactions between Enron and two private partnerships    LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co Investment  that did business with Enron  20 The partnerships entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements wi  th Enron  20 Enron declined to say if the SEC s request    which it called voluntary and   said represents an  informal inquiry     included other issues  20 The SEC request  made by fax Wednesday to Enron and followed up with a

Chief Financial Officer  Andrew Fastow  managed both of the LJM par  tnerships  according to SEC filings made by Enron last year  20 Both partnerships are described as investment companies that primarily buy   or invest in businesses involved in energy and communications  20 Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM partnerships in June amid criticism   and questions from some on Wall Street about a potential conflict of intere  st  20 Investors worried Monday that Fastow s duty to Enron shareholders competed   with his duties to LJM  Meade said  20 In a written statement Monday  Ken Lay

highlighting the LJM partnerships  Fasto  w and Enron  20 The Journal s Friday report said LJM2  realized millions of dollars in prof  its in transactions it did with Enron   and that  Fastow  and

inception  the LJM situation was obviously one that would raise eyebr  ows   said Feygin  adding Enron anticipated that and made sure proper legal   structures were in place  20 The LJM entities are what s known as off balance sheet financing vehicles    he said  Generally  they allow a corporation to take on financial obligatio  ns without having to report them as liabilities  20 Feygin also said it appeared Enron intended to give Fastow an  opportunity   to participate in the upside from these entities  to reward him  20 Even though the LJM transactions have been disclosed by Enron  Meade noted   that they are complicated  difficult to follow and their implications tough   to understand  20 In transactions detailed in an SEC filing made by Enron last year  LJM Caym  an received

Dietert  an analyst with Simmons   Co  Internati  onal in Houston  wrote in a research note Monday  20 If Enron should lose its current investment grade quality debt rating  thos  e equity commitments from Whitewing and Marlin could trigger steps that wou  ld cause the value of Enron s current outstanding shares to become diluted    20 At least two shareholders have already sued Enron s board in state district   court  while two law firms filed suit on behalf of Enron shareholders Mond  ay in federal court seeking class action status  20 Carol Caole  an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston  downgraded E  nron from a buy to a hold Monday primarily because of issues surrounding th  e credibility of Enron s management  20 Several times over the past six months  Caole asked specific questions of s  enior Enron executives  she said  They denied problems existed  but six wee  ks to two months later it was revealed there were  indeed  issues  she said    20 Coale recently asked

Broadband Servi  ces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan  y s efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with   success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy   ii  that   the Company s operating results were materially overstated as result of th  e Company failing to timely write down the value of its investments with ce

of 2001  the period ending September 30  2001  Subsequently    Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind  ing of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled   by Enron s chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin  g more than  1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o  f the investments  As this

Shares Plunge       Enron shares fell  5 40 to  20 65  They touched  19 67 during the day s trading  the lowest level since Jan  15  1998        The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about failed investments in trading of space on fiber optic communications networks and a water company  and the resignation of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job        While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons  investors say his departure led them to question whether the company was concealing problems  including possible liabilities from affiliated companies        On Tuesday  Enron surprised many investors when it reported a  618 million third quarter loss  the result of writing off  1 01 billion in failed investments        Moody s Investors Service placed the company s debt on watch for possible downgrade  The company s debt is rated at investment grade by Fitch  Standard   Poor s and Moody s        The company received a faxed request for information from the SEC on Wednesday asking for information  spokesman Mark Palmer said  and will respond   as soon as possible            We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest    Lay  who is also Enron s chairman  said in a statement                             Dilution Fears       Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing vehicles for its projects  based on filings with the Texas secretary of state  Fastow and other Enron executives are named as the controlling partners or the board members in the companies        Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants  removing the debt for those projects from Enron s books  That allows Enron to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting what it views as secondary businesses  Standard   Poor s debt analyst Todd Shipman said        Enron brokers trades of electricity  natural gas and other commodities as well as owns power plants and natural gas pipelines        Dismantling the affiliates would be costly  Whitewing Management  an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power plants and lists Fastow as managing director  holds 250 000 preferred shares of Enron        Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit rating drops below investment grade  according to company filings  That would dilute the value of common shareholders  investment          The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are out there    Shipman said    Investors are worried they might have to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they originally thought                             Worrisome Financing       Enron s auditors and attorneys reviewed the company s   related party arrangements    the board approved them  and they were disclosed in SEC filings  Enron said in its statement        That hasn t eased concerns  The reduction of shareholder equity by  1 2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to worry about Enron s other financing vehicles  wrote Niles  the Salomon analyst  Enron also may take another  2 4 billion in losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and projects in South America  he wrote                               Bonds Fall       Enron s 8 percent coupon bonds

composite ratings  most of Enron s long  term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1  two or three levels above investment grade        Fastow continues to work  and Enron hasn t punished him  Palmer said  Fastow declined to be interviewed  spokeswoman Karen Denne said  SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the agency s request to Enron          We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done    Lay said in the statement        Enron will hold a conference call to discuss investors  concerns at 9 30 a m  New

stock plunged 20  last week after the   energy giant revealed that a complex financing deal caused a  1 2 billion h  it to its equity  But other big deals that have yet to receive much public   scrutiny could further damage the company s balance sheet  20 In the spotlight last week were transactions done with investment partnersh  ips called LJM2 and LJM Cayman  An examination of the LJM2 related equity w  ritedown can be found here  20 However  the LJM deals make up only part of Enron s sophisticated financing   arrangements  Also at issue are two large trusts that contain assets Enron   shifted from its balance sheet  These are the  1 billion Marlin Water Trus  t II and the  2 4 billion Osprey Trust  usually known as Whitewing  20 The key risk for investors is how Enron chooses to repay these trusts if th  ey don t unwind as planned  The company may end up issuing stock to repay m  oney borrowed through the trusts  This would dilute existing shareholders    Alternatively  Enron could resort to using cash raised through sales of on   balance sheet assets  But this would hamper efforts to reduce debt and depr  ive the company s profitable business lines of much needed capital  20 Whitewing and a Prayer  Though set up by Enron  Marlin II and Whitewing are legally distinct from t  he company  Institutional investors bought notes issued by the trusts  The    3 4 billion in proceeds from the notes flowed to Enron  20 Both trusts are scheduled to unwind in 2003  Originally  Enron had hoped to   repay them by selling the trusts  underlying assets  This repayment method   would have had a minimal impact on Enron s balance sheet  20 However  there s a potential problem brewing with this approach  The value   of the assets may be too low to raise sufficient funds to pay back the trus  t investors  Hence Enron s two unenviable options  issuing stock  or raisin  g cash from its own balance sheet  20 Enron treasurer Ben Glisan concedes that assets in Marlin II won t be suffi  cient to pay it back  But he adds that proceeds from planned sales of on ba  lance sheet assets will provide Enron with the necessary funds for Marlin I  I  When asked if Whitewing s assets are adequate for repayment  Glisan repl  ied   We believe so   20 In reference to the two trusts  Enron CEO Kenneth Lay said on a conference   call Tuesday   We anticipate the sale of assets will be the primary source   of repayments   20 Sterling Marlin TheStreet com hasn t seen offering documentation for Whitewing  Enron didn   t provide it when requested  But TSC has reviewed the Marlin II prospectus    Here s how Marlin II works  Enron took water assets  primarily based in th  e U K   off its balance sheet  and the Marlin II trust took a stake in them    Meanwhile  Marlin II issued senior debt to investors  the proceeds of whi  ch went to Enron  The company didn t have to recognize these notes as debt   on its balance sheet  due to the structure of the trust  Marlin II replaced   a similar trust called Marlin that was set to mature at the end of this ye  ar  20 Ideally  the aim was for Enron managers to maximize the value and profitabi  lity of the assets over the life of Marlin and Marlin II so it could sell t  hem off and pay down the trusts  To cover the risk that asset sales wouldn   t raise enough money  Enron also pledged to issue as much new convertible p  referred stock as might be needed to pay off the notes  20 As it happened  the water assets didn t perform well  In fact  Enron set up   Marlin II in July to succeed the original Marlin because it wanted to avoi  d paying off the first Marlin with convertible stock  or with cash from its   own balance sheet  This move risked angering the rating agencies that had   agreed not to treat Marlin as debt because of Enron s pledge to backstop it   with preferred stock  Suddenly  it seemed Enron was wriggling out of its c  ommitment to make good with stock  20 Enron s Glisan responds that many of the investors in the first Marlin also   invested in Marlin II  illustrating that investors weren t upset by the ma  neuver  20 Glisan says Enron almost certainly won t decide to issue stock to pay off M  arlin II  Instead  he adds  money from pending asset sales can be used to p  ay it off when it matures in July 2003  When asked if Enron might use the e  xpected  1 9 billion in proceeds from selling Portland General  the utility   based in Portland  Ore   Glisan replied   That s a good one   20 But using the Portland General windfall would run counter to Enron s freque  ntly stated strategy of selling off low yielding assets and investing the p  roceeds in higher yielding businesses  Portland General is almost certainly   a more profitable business than the U K  s Wessex Water  which is the domi  nant asset in Marlin II  In addition  doing so would mean Enron couldn t us  e all the Portland proceeds to pay off debt  Enron aims to get its debt to   total capital ratio down to 40   from the current 50   20 Maturity What about Whitewing  which matures in early 2003  Glisan lists Whitewing s   assets as  Central American gas distribution assets  turbines destined for   European power stations  interests in European power stations  and various   debt and equity participations in energy investments  Glisan says these as  sets can be sold to pay off the  2 4 billion in notes issued by the trust    20 But what would happen if the Whitewing assets can t fetch the necessary pri  ce  Enron could sell off more on balance sheet assets  But  again  this wou  ldn t help debt reduction efforts  and it may be running short of large ass  ets that it can quickly sell  20 Whitewing is backed with Enron convertible stock  But Enron may be reluctan  t to issue paper when its stock is so far below recent highs  and current s  hareholders may begrudge the prospect of further dilution  20 Investors also need to keep their eyes on the early repayment triggers of t  he trusts  In fact  the stock price related element of the triggers has alr  eady been set off  For Whitewing  the stock has to fall below  59 78  for M  arlin II  the stock has to be under  34 13  However  something else has to   happen before the trust investors can claim their money back through asset   sales and stock issuance  Enron s credit rating must fall below investment   grade  That looks to be a long shot  since its rating is currently three no  tches above subinvestment grade  But it is something the market will watch   after Moody s said last week that it was putting Enron on review for a poss  ible downgrade  20 Despite all the questions stemming from the trusts  Enron still seems keen   to use the structure  Last week  Barclays Capital was inviting investors to   subscribe to an Enron related entity called the Besson Trust  This is bein  g set up to enable Enron  to monetize substantially all of its interests in   EOTT Energy Partners   an Enron affiliate that markets and transports crud  e oil  Expected proceeds from the deal are  227 million  according to the p  rospectus  Could Enron be setting up new trusts to pay off damaged old trus  ts  20 Due to off balance sheet financings like Marlin II and Whitewing  it s clea  r that uncertainty could weigh on Enron s battered stock for some time  20     Why Enron s Writedown Unnerves Some Investors By Peter Eavis  mailto peavis thestreet com  Senior Columnist TheStreet com 10 22 2001 07 15 AM EDT URL   http   www thestreet com markets detox 10002713 html   Enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors  but its decision to red  uce equity by  1 2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and conf  usion in the market  20 The action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner  More important  in  vestors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect Enron s ba  lance sheet  profits and earnings guidance  20 Enron didn t provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction    20 Enron doesn t include a balance sheet in its earnings release  so the equit  y decrease couldn t be spotted in numbers supplied Tuesday  And even though   Enron did break out  1 billion in earnings charges in its release  the com  pany didn t feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in   the text  20 Instead  the public first heard about it on a Tuesday conference call  CEO   Kenneth Lay said Enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a s  o called  structured finance arrangement   The Wall Street Journal later re  ported that Enron s counter party in this transaction was an investment par  tnership called LJM2 Co Investment  which has set up and run by Enron s fin  ance chief  Andrew Fastow  20 This is what Lay said on the Tuesday call about the equity move   In connec  tion with the early termination  shareholders  equity will be reduced appro  ximately  1 2 billion  with a corresponding significant reduction in the nu  mber of diluted shares outstanding   According to The Journal  Lay then sai  d Wednesday on another call that Enron had repurchased 55 million shares    20 Enron s supporters count Lay s mention of a reduction in the share count as   bullish  because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future    20 But there are two possible problems with this theory  20 First  Enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to mak  e  2 15 per share in operating earnings next year  Critically  the company   did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the   55 million shares or not  If the forecast does assume the exclusion of the   55 million shares  the company should have upped its 2002 per share earning  s forecast by around 6   since that s the amount by which the share count w  ill be reduced  Enron needs to say what share count it s using in its guida  nce  20 Second  it s almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever re  corded  casting a certain amount of doubt on Lay s assertion that the share   count will come down  20 Why question the CEO  Well  in its 2000 annual report  Enron included some   disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with LJM2  It reads   At Dece  mber 31  2000  Enron had derivative instruments   on 54 8 million shares of   Enron common stock   The derivative instruments appear to be types of opti  ons  or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stoc  k at agreed prices  20 But these derivatives linked shares don t show up where they should in the   annual report  in the table that breaks out the difference between the basi  c and diluted share counts  The line item in this table that shows options   related shares totals only 43 million shares  which is close to the amount   of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion  Therefore  that numbe  r almost certainly doesn t include the 55 million LJM2 related shares  The   fact is  at least some of the 55 million derivatives linked shares should b  e included if the derivatives were like normal options  That s because the   LJM2 derivatives appear to have been  in the money   or profitable for the   holders  Typically  all in the money options based stock has to be included   in the diluted share count  And these LJM2 derivatives did appear to have   that status at the end of 2000  Back then  Enron stock was trading around    80  way above the average  68 level at which these derivatives made money f  or LJM2  20 Maybe these weren t simple options and had other conditions attached that e  xcluded them from the diluted share count  That s what disclosure elsewhere   in the annual report appears to imply  Alternatively  the options were emb  edded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure  though   it s hard think where  20 Presumably  investors will get a full explanation in Enron s quarterly fina  ncial results filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission  due by th  e middle of November  '

THE NATION States Taking the Initiative to Fight Global Warming Environment    Unhappy with Bush s policies  local officials work to slow climate change    GARY POLAKOVIC TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER  10 07 2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A 40 Copyright 2001   The Times Mirror Company  More than two dozen U S  states and cities  no longer waiting for the Bush   administration to seize the initiative against global warming  have begun t  aking steps to reduce emissions that scientists say are heating the planet    20 From Vermont to Oregon  state and local governments are calling for broader   use of energy saving devices  more energy efficient building standards  cl  eaner burning power plants and more investment in such renewable energy sou  rces as wind and solar power  all to help reduce greenhouse gases that trap   the sun s energy near the Earth s surface  Many of the strategies being promoted mimic those endorsed in July by 180 n  ations as part of an international campaign against global warming that the   Bush administration declined to join  20 In August  six New England states and five eastern Canadian provinces signe  d a pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  Under the agreement  the signa  tories pledged to cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 and by 10  below tha  t level by 2020  Those cuts are to be followed by even deeper reductions  I  t is the most ambitious goal set by state governments and it was supported   by three Republican governors  two Democrats and one Independent from Massa  chusetts  Connecticut  Rhode Island  New Hampshire  Vermont and Maine  20 No single state or region can make a substantial reduction in the gases tha  t contribute to global warming  Moreover  much of the success of state and   local efforts relies on voluntary compliance from industry  20 Still  advocates of state and local initiatives are confident that there is   enough public support to ensure broad cooperation in the private sector    20  Public demand for action on climate change increased when the United State  s was not a part of the  international  agreement  It had a powerful impact   on the thinking of all kinds of people  including governors and heads of l  arge companies   said Tom Peterson  director of domestic policy for the Cen  ter for Clean Air Policy in Washington  20 The center was created in 1985 by a bipartisan group of governors to promot  e economical solutions to air pollution  20  This is a way  for states  to distinguish themselves from the Bush adminis  tration   California Resources Secretary Mary Nichols said   A lot of pract  ical  moderate people are recognizing climate change is a reality  not a th  eory  and they need to take it into account and help move the direction of   the world by doing something about it   20 California was an early leader in reducing dependence on fossil fuels that   release greenhouse gases  Today  12  of its electrical power comes from ren  ewable sources  more than any other state  20 President Bush has sent mixed signals concerning global warming  Shortly af  ter he took office  he reneged on a campaign promise to cut emissions of ca  rbon dioxide  the most abundant greenhouse gas  He said he rejected the int  ernational accord  outlined in Kyoto  Japan  in 1997 and ratified last summ  er  because it would cost U S  jobs and did not immediately impose limits o  n emissions from developing countries  including India and China  20 Last spring  Bush announced the formation of a task force of Cabinet member  s to formulate U S  policy  The work of the task force was slowed by disagr  eements among its members and by the Sept  11 terrorist attacks  20 In the meantime  several members of Congress  including Sens  James M  Jeff  ords  I Vt    John McCain  R Ariz   and Joseph I  Lieberman  D Conn    have   begun formulating policy  McCain and Lieberman announced in August that th  ey would develop legislation to cap greenhouse emissions and reduce them us  ing a market based trading mechanism  But that bill  too  has been delayed   as Congress grapples with the enormous fallout from the attacks on the Worl  d Trade Center and the Pentagon  20 Meanwhile  officials of several states say they are making measurable progr  ess  20 In New Jersey  officials say they are on track to cut greenhouse gases by 3   5  below 1990 levels by 2005  The plan relies on capturing emissions from   methane  which traps 20 times more heat than carbon dioxide  from landfills    securing voluntary reductions from various

20  By DALE LEZON Staff Houston Chronicle On his Web site  Asem Atta was hip and playful  regaling friends with accou  nts of his social escapades  20 He had plenty to tell  At 23  Atta had a good job at Enron Corp  and lived   at one of Houston s trendy midtown addresses  He wrote of sporting events a  nd fireworks shows  His computer home page featured pictures of himself and   his pet and links to Internet sites devoted to the rock bands Jane s Addic  tion and Red Hot Chili Peppers  20 He was  he said  living  La Vida Houston   20 That all changed after Sept  11  when the Pakistani national was swept up i  n the government s ever widening anti terrorist dragnet  20 Though federal law enforcement officials quickly concluded that Atta was no  t connected to the attacks in New York and near Washington  D C   he was fo  und to have an expired visa and apparently was detained by the U S  Immigra  tion and Naturalization Service  20 His co workers have not seen him since at least Sept  12  an Enron official   said  His friends have not seen him either  and they are worried  His apar  tment appears vacant  His telephone and the message service at the door to   his apartment building are disconnected  He did not tell Enron officials he   planned to leave  20  What on earth is going on   one of his close friends asked the Chronicle i  n response to an e mail message  20 Atta s plight  similar to that of many Middle Eastern immigrants  has spark  ed worries among some civil libertarians and congressional leaders  More th  an 500 people  many of them immigrants held for possible immigration violat  ions  have been detained so far as possible suspects or material witnesses   as the government s investigation broadens almost daily  20 Many were questioned and detained because they had Arabic sounding names  T  he Washington Post reported on Sept  19  for instance  that Atta was sought   for questioning because he had the same surname as one of the suspected hi  jackers  Mohamed Atta  20 The next day  the FBI said it  has no interest in  Asem Atta  but claimed t  hat he had overstayed his visa  said FBI spokesman Bob Doguim  An expired v  isa could lead to deportation  In Atta s case  that could mean being return  ed to Pakistan  a country that is bracing for possible U S  attacks on neig  hboring Afghanistan  20 Carl Rusnok  an INS spokesman  said he could not comment on individual INS   cases  20 Civil rights advocates acknowledge the need to question people to avert pos  sible terror strikes  but they fear law enforcement officers may unjustly t  arget some immigrants simply because they are foreigners  20  They re supposed to be looking for terrorists  but unfortunately they are   picking up a lot of people who haven t done anything wrong or are innocent   or of Middle Eastern descent   said Bruce Coane  an immigration attorney in   Houston and past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association    20 Coane said he fears that at least one of his clients  mistakenly hauled in   during the sweep  had his civil rights violated  20 He represents a Jordanian legal immigrant who was picked up by the INS on S  ept  21  More than a week later  the INS admitted the man had been apprehen  ded and detained without reason and should be released  Coane said  20 Coane said he could not identify the man because INS proceedings are not pu  blic  but said his client had been convicted of two misdemeanors prior to r  eceiving a green card  a document that allows noncitizens to remain in the   United States legally  20 INS can use criminal convictions as grounds for detaining immigrants  somet  imes indefinitely  or deporting them  But Coane said the INS knew about the   misdemeanors before issuing the man a green card  20 U S  Rep  Sheila Jackson Lee  D Houston  ranking member on the House Subcom  mittee on Immigration and Claims  said that in the wake of the Sept  11 att  acks  the government must give law enforcement powers to protect against po  ssible terrorist assaults  But it also must safeguard civil liberties for i  mmigrants  she added  20  We want to       make sure that people are not brought in unfairly for que  stioning   she said  20 Congress is considering measures to broaden anti terrorist police powers  s  uch as holding immigrants with possible links to terrorism longer between c  ourt appearances  20 Edward Gillett  a Houston immigration attorney  said he does not fault the   INS for interviewing immigrants to find possible links to the hijackers or   immigration violations  Had the hijackers  immigration status been reviewed   ahead of time  he said  the attacks may have been prevented  Several of th  e suicide hijackers had immigration violations that were not uncovered unti  l after the attacks  20  I wish they d done this before it happened and maybe they could have preve  nted some of it   Gillett said  20 Efforts to reach Atta or determine his whereabouts last week were unsuccess  ful  20 Typically  when a visa is expired  according to the INS  the agency can det  ain the immigrant but must explain to him within 72 hours why he is being h  eld and what charges he faces  20 Soon after that  the immigrant would probably be given a bond hearing to de  termine if he should be detained while awaiting a hearing on his possible d  eportation  The INS can hold immigrants indefinitely if they are deemed a f  light risk or a danger to the community  20 The deportation hearing may not take place for weeks or months  depending o  n the immigration judge s work load  20 To stay in the country legally  Atta  or anyone in his situation  may be ab  le to obtain a sponsor   a relative or employer who is a U S  citizen  for   instance   or could marry a U S  citizen  He may be able to return to his n  ative country to apply for another visa  If his visa has been expired for m  ore than one year and he leaves the country  however  he will be barred fro  m returning for 10 years  20 If the visa has expired for 180 days or more  and he leaves the country  he   won t be allowed to return for three years  20 Atta could also apply for political asylum  20 Sahdi Shalabi  24  one of Atta s closest friends from high school  said he   had hoped to see Atta in the next few weeks  But now he is uncertain  He de  scribed his friend  whom he first met in Kuwait in 1990  as  very playful    very easy going   He liked computers and talking to girls  20 Shalabi said Atta attended an English style high school in Kuwait and that   Atta s father worked for the Kuwait Oil Co  Atta moved to the United States   after graduating from high school  enrolled at Wichita State University ab  out 1994 and landed a job at Enron in Houston in 1999  20 According to his resume  Atta played indoor soccer at college and coached a   soccer team for young girls  20 Shalabi  who works for Nortel Networks in Ontario  Canada  said his friend   was Muslim but did not

operatorship of the assets to   pass to two of Enron s joint venture partners    state owned Oil   Natural   Gas Corp  and Reliance Industries Ltd     rather than remain with Enron Oil     Gas India  20 Such a development would render the acquisition unattractive for the U K  c  ompany and likely scupper the deal  20 A BG spokeswoman said the company still has  every confidence  Enron Oil     Gas India will retain the operating license for the assets  adding that not  hing has changed since the deal was announced  Negotiations are continuing   with the joint venture partners and the Indian

advocates are understandably raising concerns a  bout the substantial utility rate hikes that went into effect this week  20 Considering utility costs  the raises can be justified  But the fragile sta

natural gas to 31 5 percent to 53 percen  t for electricity come at a time when users will have a tougher time absorb  ing increases  The announcement that Northwest Natural Gas may acquire Port  land General Electric wouldn t have any impact on current rates  And adjust  ing rates won t be a simple matter of pleading economic duress  20 The PUC approved the rate hike  based on the utilities  increased costs and   their legal guarantee of a regulated profit  It turned down advocates  app  eals for a postponement  But properly  it did agree to consider whether it   would revisit rate cases

Ltd Asia Africa Intel Wire  Business Line  The Hindu  Copyr  ight  C  2001 Kasturi   Sons Ltd  All Rights Res d  NEW DELHI  Oct  5  THE Ministry of Shipping has expressed its willingness t  o take a cut in the charter hire rates for the LNG shipping deal for the tr  oubled Dabhol Power Company  DPC  in a bid to scale down the shipping costs   and salvage the LNG facility planned by Enron  20 This was indicated by the Shipping Ministry during a meeting held here on T  hursday between the financial institutions and the Government in which mini  stries and departments concerned with various aspects of the deal participa  ted  The Shipping Ministry controls the Shipping Corporation of India  SCI  whic  h is a 20 per cent equity partner in the joint venture Greenfield Shipping   Company formed for owning and operating a 137 000 cubic metre capacity tank  er for transporting LNG from Oman to the Enron promoted power plant in Maha  rashtra  now clouded in controversy  20 While the shipbuilding cost of  220 million is unlikely to be pared down ma  inly due to the fact that the 137 000 cubic metre tanker is nearing complet  ion at Japan s Mitsubishi yard  the promoters of LNG Laxmi will have to go   for a cut in the time charter hire rate of  98 600 per day for 10 years agr  eed with the DPC  Government sources told Business Line  20 The Greenfield Shipping Company will have to take possession of the LNG ves  sel on November 15 when the tanker will be ready for delivery as per the Sh  ipbuilding Contract  SBC  signed with the Japanese yard  20 The Godbole Committee set up by the Maharashtra Government to review the En  ron deal had concluded  among other things  that the time charter hire rate   of  98 600 per day agreed between DPC and Greenfield Shipping Company was   very much on the higher side  20 A section within the Government even thinks that the contracted shipbuildin  g cost of  220 million comprising a bare vessel cost of  189 million and fi  nancing cost of  21 million was higher than the market price prevailing at   the time by atleast  18 000 to  20 000  20 With the power project facing trouble  the lenders to the LNG shipping proj  ect led by ANZ Investment Bank has declared an event of default and suspend  ed the last trance of the project loan worth  55 million out of a total loa  n component of  165 million  20 The three promoters will now have to make up for the gap in the project fun  ding by putting in additional money in proportion to their equity holding t  o get the project going  20 Besides SCI  Japan s Mitsui O S K Lines hold 60 per cent equity while Atlan  tic Commercial Inc  an Enron affiliate  has the remaining 20 per cent  20 However  sources feel that SCI s additional investment in the project along  with a proposed cut in the charter hire rate  this has to be re negotiated   with the new owner of DPC  suggested by the Shipping Ministry  would render   SCI s investment in the LNG shipping project unviable  20 Another spot of bother for the SCI is that the time charter hire rates for   LNG shipping have gone down substantially from the time when the time chart  er party was signed with DPC at a rate of  98 600 per day  20 With the LNG facility of DPC now put on the back  burner and given the fact   that the tanker will have to be deployed elsewhere on spot basis upon poss  ession till the fate of the proposed LNG facility is decided  sources said   that the viability of the project will not work out in the face of a declin  ing trend world wide in the charter hire rates for LNG shipping  20 The charter hire rates are now ruling about  67 000 per day and are expecte  d to dip even further to about  50 000 per day   In such a scenario  SCI s   investments would fetch only a paltry 4 per cent to 4 5 per cent rate of re  turn as against the Government norm of 12 per cent for projects involving s  tate  funding   the sources said  20 P Manoj and Balaji C Mouli  Copyright

by the Sun Sentinel   In an attempt to serve South Florida s surging energy market  an internatio  nal power company has bought a tiny Bahamas island where it plans to build   a  1 3 billion complex of electric power and natural gas plants  20 AES Corp   which owns power plants all over the world  purchased Ocean Cay    a manmade island about 50 miles east of Miami  The 90  acre island  part o  f the Bimini Islands  is the site of an aragonite mine  But under a proposal outlined this week to state and Broward County officia  ls  the island would become an important offshore power supplier to Florida    Liquified natural gas would arrive in tankers  A plant would convert it t  o gaseous form and it would be sent to Port Everglades through a 70 mile un  dersea pipeline  The company also plans to build a 1 200 megawatt power pla  nt  with an undersea transmission line to South Florida  20  It s a good project to deliver energy into the state of Florida   said Don   Bartlett  vice president of AES Coral Inc   the company s Miami subsidiary     It s a very economically doable project   20 With its proposal  AES has emerged as a rival to Enron Corp  and El Paso Co  rp  in the race to build an undersea natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas   to the United States  20 AES Corp   based in Arlington  Va   is one of the biggest energy companies   in the world  The company owns or holds interests in 180 power plants in Ch  ina  Sri Lanka  Argentina  Hungary  Brazil and many other countries  20 It reported revenues of  6 7 billion last year and employs 60 000 people    20 All three companies  proposals will face hard questions from regulators abo  ut public safety  possible damage to coral reefs and potential harm to othe  r ocean habitats  20 Mary Murphy  a state DEP administrator who met with the AES representatives    said she told them that they would have to explain how they would cross t  he bands of coral reefs along the coast  20 They would have to show how the pipeline would avoid harming wetlands while   on land  20 They would have to show whether the route would go through populated areas   or heavily trafficked sections of Port Everglades and how they would keep t  he public safe from accidents  20  We re looking at public health and safety  the environment  and we want to   know what they re going to do to address these concerns   she said   We wa  nt to know if they re going through residential areas  if they re going thr  ough commercial areas  What kinds of reef are you impacting  Are you going   to drag your pipes along the reefs  They need to look at the other uses      beach renourishment  cables  treasure salvage leases  possible archaeologic  al sites   20 Bartlett said the company would work with environmental officials to find a   route that minimizes environmental harm  The company plans to drill a rout  e under the reefs  using the technique of horizontal drilling  which should   leave the reefs undisturbed  he said  20  Our objective is to not have any environmental impact at all  and that s w  hat we re trying to achieve   he said  20 By building a power plant offshore  AES would avoid the local opposition th  at doomed two power plant proposals in South Florida this year  20  The advantage to Broward County and the state of Florida is that 1 200 meg  awatts will come ashore without siting a power plant in Broward County   Ba  rtlett said   Siting plants in South Florida is pretty tough   20 In addition to directly supplying electricity  the project would deliver na  tural gas to the region s power plants  20 Demand for natural gas has surged in the United States  The vast majority o  f new electric power plants use it for fuel because it generates far less p  ollution than coal or oil  20 Two power plants proposed for Deerfield Beach would both use natural gas  a  lthough one would use diesel oil as a backup fuel in case the natural gas s  upply was interrupted  20 But the AES proposal faces competition from two Houston energy companies  E  l Paso Corp  has proposed a natural gas pipeline from Grand Bahama Island t  o a point near the Port of Palm Beach  where it would hook up with the stat  e s gas transmission system  Enron Corp  has filed applications for permits   to construct a pipeline from Grand Bahama to Port Everglades  20 The decision on who gets to build the pipeline could ultimately be up to th  e Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  which governs the distribution of n  atural gas throughout the country  Enron has moved the furthest in the appr  oval process  having filed applications with the commission  the state Depa  rtment of Environmental Protection and other agencies  20 It is unclear whether all three pipeline projects could go forward  since t  hey would be seeking to sell natural gas to many of the same customers  Enr  on spokesman John Ambler said the state s demand for energy could support m  ore than one new source of supply  20  I think it s clear that Florida needs more gas   he said   A diversity of   sources of supply is probably a good thing  I don t know if we need all of   the proposals that are being speculated about  But the demand projection ov  er the next 10 years is that Florida is going to need another 12 000 megawa  tts of power  and that means a lot of gas is going to be needed    MAP  Caption  Staff graphic Map

2001 South Florida Sun Sentinel Broward Metro 1B  Copyright 2001 by the Sun Sentinel   A deal in the works between top officials at City Hall and a Houston based   power company may remove a critical sticking point for people who oppose pl  ans for a 510 megawatt energy plant here  20 Deerfield Beach Mayor Al Capellini said representatives of Enron Corp  last   month asked to make minor changes to their financial agreement with the ci  ty  In exchange  Capellini wants the company to abandon plans to use diesel   fuel as a backup power source for their proposed power plant on Green Road   just east of Florida s Turnpike  That s an important condition for government officials in Coral Springs and   other North Broward cities  who fear that diesel fuel emissions would poll  ute the air in the region  Enron s plans call for the plant to be fueled pr  imarily by natural gas  which is relatively clean  but they want to be able   to use diesel fuel in case the gas runs out  20  If they want to open up their  financial  agreement  they would have to re  move the diesel fuel part of their plant   Capellini said  20 The financial agreement calls for Enron to pay the city  1 5 million in fee  s before they build the plant  and at least  1 7 million in property taxes   annually  Enron last week paid the first  500 000 of the fees  but they hav  e asked for a different payment schedule  Capellini said  20 Enron officials want to be able to burn diesel fuel as a backup power sourc  e because currently  only one natural gas pipeline operates in Florida  But   two other pipelines    one coming across the Gulf of Mexico and the other   coming from the Bahamas    are in the works  20 Enron might be willing to drop their plans for diesel fuel  but only if  on  e or both  of those pipelines works by the time they build their plant  sai  d Eric Thode  a company spokesman  20  Functionally  the plant is an ambulance service   Thode said   It has to b  e able to be used at a moment s notice   20 If Capellini were to convince Enron Corp  to drop the diesel fuel portion o  f their plans  it would represent a political victory for him and his city    That s because the mayor of Coral Springs  one of the cities that has chal  lenged the state s intention to give Enron an air quality permit  has said   that he will back off if they drop their plans to burn diesel fuel  20 So far  Coral Springs has declined to take as aggressive a stance as neighb  oring Coconut Creek  where government attorneys sued Deerfield Beach on Jul  y 13  Coconut Creek attorneys argue that a conflict in zoning laws made it   illegal for Deerfield Beach city officials to approve the Enron plant the w  ay they did  20 Broward Circuit Judge Leonard Stafford dismissed the lawsuit last month bec  ause he said Coconut Creek had not followed proper procedure  but allowed t  he city to change the suit and file again  Last week  they did just that  s  aid Mitch Bernstein  an attorney for Coconut Creek  20  The claims are essentially the same  but they are more thoroughly supporte  d by the events that took place in Deerfield Beach when they considered Enr  on s application   Bernstein said  20 Capellini said Tuesday evening there were numerous parts of Coconut Creek s   lawsuit that are inaccurate  20 Jeremy Milarsky can be reached at jmilarsky sun sentinel com or call 954 57  2

led the state in    slamming  complaints on allegations of attempting to sign up electric cust  omers without their consent  state records show  20 The Texas Public Utility Commission has received at least 14 complaints aga  inst the Enron created NewPower Co  and one each against providers Green Mo  untain  Reliant  First Choice and Shell  according to documents filed with   state regulators  The Texas electric deregulation law prohibits the practice and sets penalti  es of up to  5 000 per day  per customer  but the PUC has taken no official   enforcement action against any of the companies  20  Slamming  is slang for changing customers  utility providers without their   permission  20 A NewPower spokeswoman said the company is aware of the complaints and has   begun an investigation  20  NewPower has a zero tolerance policy towards slamming   said company spoke  swoman Terri Cohen   We have more than 50 000 Texans who have chosen to swi  tch to NewPower  Even a fraction of a percent of slamming complaints    whi  ch is what this is    is not acceptable to us   20 Under the state s new deregulation law  companies such as NewPower can offe  r lower prices and different service plans to lure customers away from the   state s utility companies  20 A pilot project that began this year allows companies to compete for up to   5 percent of customers  Most of the Texas market will open Jan  1  20 The process is overseen by the PUC and a nonprofit corporation that manages   the state s electric power grid  20 Under the Texas Open Records Act  the Star Telegram obtained information on   68 complaints about the pilot project filed between March 1 and Sept  27    Other complaints involved billing  customer frustrations over delays in the   pilot project  customer service and deceptive trade practices  20 James Pittman  52  of Houston  said he switched to NewPower after a telepho  ne marketer told him he would have to choose a new electric company    or t  he state would choose one for him  20 Pittman said the telemarketer incorrectly told him he would have to pay fee  s for a forced switch but could switch to NewPower for no charge  20  I just flat out told her that I just got out of the hospital from a heart   attack  and I didn t feel like I was up to any of this   Pittman said  20  She told me that I had to change  electric service   or the state would ch  ange it for me  She said it wouldn t be our choice  It would be whatever th  e state decided   20 Pittman said he then had difficulty switching back to Reliant  20 Several Texas residents  including some TXU customers in North Texas  also   reported receiving switch notifications even though they had not requested   new service  20 PUC spokesman Terry Hadley said some of the slamming complaints may have be  en prompted by computer glitches at the power grid  Others may have been ca  used by confusion by marketers and the public over the new deregulation law    20 Hadley said regulators will continue to monitor complaints  although it is   premature for the PUC to take enforcement actions  20  It s early in the game and we would expect that as education increases  we   might not see the so called complaints in the future   Hadley said  20 He said lawmakers had inserted strong anti slamming language into the dereg  ulation law after witnessing similar problems with the deregulation of long   distance telephone service  The PUC received 5 700 such complaints in one   year alone  he said  20 But Reggie James  director of the Austin office of the Consumers Union  sai  d the PUC should have done a better job of educating consumers about their   rights under the new law  20 He said a  12 million customer education campaign by the PUC has focused fo  r the most part on  happy talk  to defend deregulation  20  If deregulation is going to work  it will require the confidence of all co  nsumers   said James   And if people think they re going to get ripped off   by the companies that are competing  it will hurt all the competitors   20 Complaints about slamming and other problems can be lodged with the PUC by   calling  888  782 8477   Copyright   2000 Dow

JARNOLD  Non Privileged  Arnold  John Deleted Items X Origin  Arnold J X FileName  JARNOLD  Non Privileged  pst   Today  we announced our third quarter earnings results  which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of  0 43   This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year  which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines   In addition  we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of  0 45 for the fourth quarter   1 80 for 2001  and  2 15 for 2002   We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron s business strategy and performance  so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter   Over the past few months  we have met with analysts to discuss Enron s performance   We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units   In response to that feedback  we have provided results separately for several of our business units   For example  while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe  this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities   In addition  information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services   This quarter they are reported separately    Finally  even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services  we are continuing to report that business separately   Following are the highlights of our businesses   Wholesale Services  Total income before interest  minority interests and taxes  IBIT  increased 28  to  754 million in the third quarter   Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65  to 88 2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day  Tbtue d   Americas  IBIT increased 31  to  701 million   Natural gas volumes increased 6  to 26 7 Tbtu d  and power volumes increased 77  to 290 million megawatt hours  MWh   Europe and Other Commodity Markets  IBIT remained unchanged at  53 million as compared to last year   While physical gas and power volumes increased  low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat   Retail Services  Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of  71 million  compared to  27 million a year ago   So far this year  EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95 000 deals with small business customers    Transportation and Distribution   Natural Gas Pipelines  IBIT increased slightly to  85 million in the third quarter  Portland General  We reported an IBIT loss of   17  million this quarter compared to IBIT of  74 million a year ago   This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter   Last week  we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural   This transaction is expected to close next year  Global Assets  This segment includes Elektro  Dabhol  TGS  Azurix and Enron Wind   Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at  19 million compared to last year   Broadband Services  IBIT losses were   80  million in the current quarter compared to a   20  million loss last year   This quarter s results include significantly lower investment related income and lower operating costs   Corporate and other  This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions  This segment reported an IBIT loss of   59  million compared to   106  million a year ago   In addition  this quarter we announced one time charges of  1 01 billion   Over the past few quarters  we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses   These charges include    A  287 million write down of Azurix Corp     183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services   This includes severance costs  a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers  and a write down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers     544 million related to losses from certain investments  primarily Enron s interest in The New Power Company  broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement     With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things   1  we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses  2  we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses  and 3  We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors  To read the full earnings press release  go

effect immediately  e g  additional security personne  l  and some are phasing in   While not all of the changes will be visible    there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities   In all th  e steps we take and recommendations we make  we will be making our faciliti  es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi  ty  while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day to day business   Primary responsibility for Enron Corp  Security resides in our business con  trols organization   You can contact this organization through their websit  e

this organization   Pleas  e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions    or to report security threats   We have two areas to update you on   changes in the access procedures for t  he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory   Access to the Enron Center  Over the next few days  the following access control procedures will be ins  tituted at the Enron Center  and other facilities where practical      09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron   Center  a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer     09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid   picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center  U S  driver s license  U S    or foreign passport  or some form of U S  federal  state or local identif  ication   20    09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing   in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca  rd   Adult visitors without a valid photo ID  U S  driver s license  U S  o  r foreign passport  or some form of U S  federal  state or local identifica  tion  will not be allowed access to the Enron Center     09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b  adged contractor at all times     09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo  yee or badged contractor  signed into a visitor s log at the lobby receptio  n area by the employee or badged contractor  and escorted to their appointm  ent   At the conclusion of the appointment  the visitor will be escorted to   the lobby by an employee or badged contractor  the visitor badge collected    and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the   escorting employee or badged contractor     09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their   workplace by following these guidelines  report suspicious activity to Secu  rity  phone 3 6300   do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y  ou or hold doors open  allowing  tail gating  by others   These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit  uted at Enron   We ask that all employees be patient during congested times   in the lobby   As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi  pment  we expect the inconvenience to decrease   We hope you understand the  se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees   09   Travel Advisory Update  With the beginning of retaliatory strikes  we have two important recommenda  tions     09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing  corporate security recommend  s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided   We continue to str  ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan  Yemen  Pak  istan  Indonesia  Iran  Iraq  Sudan  Somalia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan  Geo  rgia  and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled   In addition  we recommend that   planned travel to Egypt  Israel  Gaza West Bank  Jordan  Lebanon  Saudi Ara  bia  Syria  and Algeria be very carefully considered     09For non U S  citizens traveling in the United States  corporate securit  y recommends that you carry documentation   There have been several recent   reports of non U S  citizens who reside in the United States being question  ed and asked for documentation when boarding U S  domestic flights  As a re  sult  we suggest that all non U S  citizens who currently reside in the Uni  ted States   and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status   carry th  eir passport  Form I 94 and Form I 797 at all times   We would also suggest   that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident  Green  Card   as proof of their status as a precautionary measure   It appears that Immi  gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National  ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his her  regi  stration  documentation with them at all times  This can include a Permanen  t Resident Card  Form I 94 card  Employment Authorization Card  Border Cros  sing Card  or a Temporary Resident Card  Immigration Officials have not his  torically been asking domestic travelers for  registration  documentation    but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere  it   would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c  urrent lawful status   We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor  ate Security website and by e mail  as appropriate   '

Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal  10 24 2001 The Wall Street Journal A2  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    Enron Corp  might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created  Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron shares  diluting the position of current shareholders   However  Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about  3 3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock  The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities    known as the Marlin Water Trust II  the Marlin Water Capital Corp  II  the Osprey Trust and Osprey I  Inc  The notes are coming due during the next 20 months  Mr  Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes  Also  Enron is selling other assets  Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes  which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron   He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least  2 2 billion by the end of next year  This amount includes cash proceeds of  1 55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron s Portland General Electric utility unit  Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002    There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds  to repay the notes  Mr  Glisan said   But if we are wrong  we will issue equity   Mr  Glisan said a worst case scenario would involve issuing as much as  1 billion in stock  Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding   Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron s share price  In 4 p m  New York Stock Exchange composite trading  Enron shares were down 86 cents to  19 79  The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands  Early this year  Enron stock was more than  80 a share   During the past week  shares of the energy trading giant have dropped more than 40   Early last week  Enron reported a  618 million third quarter loss  resulting from  1 01 billion in write offs  The company also disclosed a  1 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S  Fastow  In July  Mr  Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors  On Monday  Enron disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr  Fastow  Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper   The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors  Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said while  we are extremely disappointed with our stock price       our businesses are performing very well   Mr  Lay and other executives said Enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs   Mr  Fastow  the chief financial officer  took part in the conference call  But neither he nor Mr  Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastow related partnership  which was known as LJM2 Co Investment LP  Mr  Lay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement  which has raised conflict of interest questions among analysts and others  Mr  Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions  Mr  Lay said he was  very concerned about the way Andy s character has been loosely tossed about   He added  we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy    Internal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr  Fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership  Billions of dollars of Enron assets and stock were involved in LJM2 related transactions  according to Enron SEC filings   During the conference call  analysts    even some who have been longtime Enron fans    challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement and the company s often opaque financial reports   There s the appearance you are hiding something   said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer   You need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board    Mr  Lay responded   We re trying to be as transparent as we can    Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved      Business Financial Desk  Section C Enron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts By FLOYD NORRIS  10 24 2001 The New York Times Page 1  Column 5 c  2001 New York Times Company  Enron has ample access to cash  the company s chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write offs stemming from unusual financing activities   In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron s stock plunged on Monday  the chief executive  Kenneth W  Lay  strongly defended the company s chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into  But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S  Fastow  the chief financial officer  In addition  Mr  Fastow  while declaring that Enron   expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations    declined to answer any questions about it   The conference call  which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange  at first seemed to be reassuring investors  Within minutes of the beginning of the call  the share price rallied to  23 25  But it soon began falling  and ended the day down 86 cents  at  19 79  The day s low of  19 62 was the lowest since Jan  12  1998  and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000   Until recently  most investors focused on the company s reported operating earnings  which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets  But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions  some involving off balance sheet financing  One  involving partnerships controlled by Mr  Fastow  led to a  1 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S E C  inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday   One of the company s strongest supporters has been David Fleischer  an analyst at Goldman  Sachs  But he told Mr  Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information    There is an appearance that you are hiding something    he said   After the call  Mr  Fleischer expressed disappointment    They ve engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about  and that are hard to understand    he said in an interview    They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them   as is needed  he said  But he said he was still recommending the stock    I don t think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans    he said    In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company  there is tremendous value here     Mr  Lay cited the S E C  inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr  Fastow  But he emphasized that both he and the company s board   continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy     Mr  Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron s reporting in conjunction with another off balance sheet vehicle  called Marlin  That company owns one third of Azurix  an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex  a British water utility  The auditors   have determined there is no write down required    he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management  a money management firm   Mr  Grubman said that Marlin owed almost  1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake  Noting that Enron had paid about  300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write downs on its investment in Azurix  Mr  Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt  which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares   Mr  Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details  Eventually he cut off Mr  Grubman    I know you re trying to drive the stock price down  and you ve done a pretty good job of it    Mr  Lay said    But let s move on to the next question     Mr  Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had  1 85 billion in such debt outstanding  He said it was backed by  3 35 billion in bank lines of credit  of which  1 75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed   Mr  Lay said he was sorry about   the misunderstanding   that resulted when his brief mention of the  1 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts  That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report  but it did not  He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future  but made no promises   The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings  and so was not in the earnings release  But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement  The S E C  is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct   After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin  Mr  Lay said the company   will look into providing   such statements   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights

Inc    NEW YORK    Bullish calls traded heavily early as investors  encouraged by the ability of stocks to shrug off anthrax scares  bought calls to replace stock holdings and to ride any rallies   At one point  the ratio of equity calls traded to puts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange fell to 0 28  compared with 0 68 Friday and Monday s three month closing low of 0 42  The surge of optimism    also evident in the CBOE market volatility index  or VIX    prompted traders to begin covering the downside  just as the widely watched stock indexes began to retreat  Contrarians believe the CBOE equity put call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0 40  By the session s end  the ratio was at 0 49   Buyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems  a maker of Internet switching equipment  and the implied volatility also rose  noted a trader at Letco  the CBOE specialist for Cisco options  One investor bought thousands of January 20 calls  paying about  115 a contract for the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at  20 a share until mid January  At 4 p m  in Nasdaq Stock Market trading  Cisco was down 42 cents at  16 41  The January 20 calls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27 048 contracts  while 6 861 contracts traded at the Pacific Exchange   The implied volatility of Enron s near month options remains high  even as the energy concern s executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns  following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the Houston company   The volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles    selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration  In particular  Enron s at the money January 20 straddles offer rich premiums  said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman Skupp options team at Miller Tabak   Co   of New York  With Enron down 86 cents at  19 79 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading  selling January 20 straddles would earn an investor about  750 a straddle    a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock   To be sure  selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock  which already had fallen about 38  in a week  makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire  Investors typically buy straddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock  while sellers pocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved     Oct  24  2001  12 05AM Houston Chronicle Lay tries to assure Enron investors  Company s credibility questioned  By LAURA GOLDBERG  Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle  Enron had safeguards in place to protect shareholder interests while its chief financial officer ran two investment partnerships that did business with Enron  the company s chief executive officer said Tuesday   The Houston based energy trader has been caught in a storm of criticism over Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow s former role with two partnerships  LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co Investment  that entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with Enron   Enron disclosed Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an  informal inquiry  into transactions between Enron and the two partnerships   It declined to say if the SEC is looking into other transactions   After the disclosure  Enron s stock fell almost 21 percent Monday  Tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at  19 79   The news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall Street that some of Enron s financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that Enron doesn t provide detailed enough financial data about its performance   Tuesday morning  Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for investors and analysts  aimed at addressing their concerns   It remains to be seen whether he succeeded  but based on the tenor of questions during the call  it s doubtful he achieved that result   David Fleischer  a Goldman Sachs analyst  told Lay that the company s credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that Enron s dealings are aboveboard    I  for one  find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions   he said   Lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships because of the SEC inquiry   He did say Enron was aware an  inherent conflict of interest  would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with Enron   In response  Enron set up procedures  which Lay said were rigorously followed  to ensure shareholder interests wouldn t be compromised    There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron   he said  adding that Enron wasn t obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in Enron s best interest   Lay and Enron s board continue to have the  highest faith and confidence  in Fastow  he added   Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from Wall Street   Enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships   It took a  35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders  equity by  1 2 billion as a result   During the call Enron executives also addressed other issues   They stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles  Whitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust  that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the investments   If Enron should lose its current investment grade quality debt rating  commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron s current outstanding shares to become diluted   Jeff Dietert  an analyst with Simmons   Co  International in Houston who follows Enron  was among those on the call  He said afterward he received some new information about Enron s lines of credit    I had hoped to

additional shares  thereby diluting the position of current shareholders  the report said  The report  which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan  said the notes were sold to investors during recent

Newswires  10 24 2001 The Wall Street Journal C2  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    NEW YORK    Stocks ended only slightly lower as the recently resilient market largely withstood the effects of dismal corporate profit statements   Shares of drug maker Pharmacia fell  4 37  or 13   to  38 39  after the company issued third quarter results that topped Wall Street s forecasts  but also issued 2002 profit projections that left some analysts disappointed  In fact  several drug companies saw their stock prices fall as investors responded to their quarterly profit statements  Shares of Bristol Myers Squibb  for example  gave up 1 68  or 2 8   to 58 02  American Home Products lost 1 40  or 2 3   to 58 90  and Schering Plough eased 74 cents  or 1 9   to 38 17   Shares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in reaction to profit statements  with Everest Re falling 6 40  or 8 4   to 69 50  and St  Paul dropping 93 cents  or 1 9   to 49 25   Power utility Exelon  Chicago  was set back 3 42  or 7 7   to 41 08  after its third quarter results topped forecasts  but drew critical comments from several analysts   Nevertheless  even with the grim earnings outlook  investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel    Institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market   Richard Cripps  market strategist at Legg Mason  said   Their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly  which is eminently possible  and they can t afford to miss it    Some seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently  For many mutual funds  for example  their fiscal year concludes at the end of October  Some are doing what is called window dressing    buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio    while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market   Whatever the reason  the market has been making some big moves when prices have risen  and modest moves when they have declined  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  which ran up 172 92 points Monday  declined 36 95 points yesterday  a loss of 0 39   to 9340 08   The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 3 64 points  or 0 21   to 1704 44  Volume levels showed some improvement over Monday s rather sluggish pace   Investors haven t completely rolled over

additional 86 cents  or 4 2   to 19 79  hitting a 52 week low intraday   There were some winning profit statements  Shares of CSX  for example  rose 2 45  or 7 5   to 35 19  after the Richmond  Va   rail freight concern reported third quarter earnings that  while they fell short of year ago performance  nevertheless managed to top Wall Street s forecasts   Vitesse Semiconductor  Nasdaq   a Camarillo  Calif   maker of integrated circuits used in high bandwidth communications networks  added 43 cents  or 4 5   to 9 99  even though the company s losses for its fiscal fourth quarter proved sharper than expected   NetIQ  Nasdaq  dropped 4 23  or 14   to 26 17  even though the Santa Clara  Calif   developer of networking software posted fiscal first quarter results late Monday that topped what analysts had been looking for   Chartered Semiconductor  Nasdaq  advanced 40 cents  or 2 1   to 19 10  The Singapore chip foundry reported third quarter results that showed a loss for the period  but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected   Shares of several cable television operators moved higher  Charter Communications added 59 cents  or 4 5   to 13

provider of wireless communications services reported third quarter results that topped what analysts had been looking for   Several steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late Monday by the U S  Trade Commission  which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have been significantly harmed by cheap imports  the ruling could lead to the erection of barriers limiting steel imports  USX U S  Steel Group gained 28 cents  or 1 9   to 15 02  Nucor rose 1 05  or 2 5   to 42 87  and AK Steel improved 41 cents  or 4 6   to 9 31   McKesson advanced 1 56  or 4 2   to 38 95  The San Francisco drug

the global LNG industry will be finely poised in coming years between profitability and a crisis of oversupply if projects miss their deadlines  shipping analysts warn   More LNG tankers than ever before are being constructed in the shipyards of the Far East  many of them ordered speculatively against anticipated demand  which might emerge later than scheduled   The issue is timing   Jarle Sjo  shipping equity analyst at Oslo based investment bank First Securities told Reuters    Historically  LNG projects have been delayed   you can estimate at about six months   and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term   he added   The world fleet of LNG tankers currently numbers 123  but will have swollen by about 37 percent by the end of 2004  according to shipping database Fairplay   Gas industry analysts expect some LNG projects to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn  excess capacity at existing plants in Asia and a sharp fall in U S  natural gas prices this year   Svein Erik Amundsen  Managing Director of Norwegian shipping group Bergesen  said that a sustained economic downturn could have  consequences     I wouldn t be surprised by project delays   he told Reuters   This could result in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment     I think you can say we re still optimistic  but more cautiously optimistic than before   he added  Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order  two of which have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas   STOP AND THINK  The world s largest and only pure LNG shipping player  Golar LNG  historically bullish in its outlook  has also been forced to stop and consider the problem   Golar has six ships locked into long term contracts  but four more are under construction at South Korea s Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment    There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered   Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told Reuters   The only risk is things might be delayed    Stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option  but it was also developing an LNG trading arm  which might have a use for some of them   Golar s closest competitor in terms of size  Exmar  is taking a more traditional approach  It has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance    We ve chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship  which is under offer for the  Qatari  RasGas tender   Managing Director Nicolas Saverys told Reuters  Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron   He said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production Agreements in place  it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship

huge companies  Senate Democrats present alternative By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer  10 23 2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001  The Associated Press  All Rights Reserved   WASHINGTON  AP    General Motors  IBM and Kmart are among corporations that would receive billions of dollars in tax refunds under a  100 billion House Republican economic stimulus package  Democrats say it is far too generous to companies and does too little for individuals   Seven companies would get a total of  3 3 billion in refunds of alternative minimum taxes they paid as far back as 1986  The tax  which the House legislation also would repeal outright  is intended to ensure a basic minimum income tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous deductions and credits  IBM would get a  1 4 billion refund  according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service  while GM would get  832 million  Kmart  102 million and General Electric  671 million  Others specified for big refunds include energy giant Enron  at  254 million  U S  Steel   39 million  and grocery chain Kroger   9 million   In addition  the study found that Ford Motor Co  would get a refund that could total  2 3 billion  while Chevron s could reach  314 million   Counting repeal of the tax  corporations would get more than  25 billion in tax relief from these minimum tax provisions in 2002 alone  In addition  the bill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firms doing a lot of overseas business  providing them  21 billion in tax relief over 10 years   The generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in the House GOP measure  scheduled for a floor vote Wednesday  Democrats say the measure is certain to change once it reaches the Senate  the Bush administration also has signaled that  100 billion is too costly    It s clear the House bill cannot pass the Senate as it is   said Sen  John Breaux  D La   For individuals  the House legislation includes a new round of tax rebate checks for workers who didn t get them this summer and a cut in the current 27 percent income tax rate to 25 percent in 2002  four years earlier than under the just enacted tax cut  The measure also reduces capital gains rates from 20 percent to 18 percent for most taxpayers  enhances business equipment write offs and allows companies to deduct current losses against taxes paid five years earlier   The primary sponsor  Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas  said in a newspaper opinion piece published Tuesday in USA Today that the legislation  is a shot of adrenaline  that will help restart the economy while not triggering inflation    Businesses generate jobs  and jobs are the core of a strong economy   wrote Thomas  R Calif   While bipartisan support backs some of the House items  Senate Democrats have been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers who lose health insurance  Sen  Max Baucus  chairman of the Senate Finance Committee  presented a  70 billion proposal Tuesday that would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks  provide a 50 percent federal match for COBRA health insurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for Medicaid   The legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar to the House bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative minimum tax relief  Tax cuts in the Baucus measure would total  35 billion in 2002  far below the House GOP level    This proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times  helping this nation get back to work and recover quickly   said Baucus  D Mont   Other Democrats were working on spending programs  Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd  D W Va   said he was putting together a  20 billion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and food inspectors  augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more vaccines   Sen  Charles Grassley  R Iowa  said President Bush does not want the stimulus bill laden with additional spending    Everything in this package needs to be stimulative   Grassley said   There needs to be more done on the investment side

the Year    She upgraded from a four door   Not her style   The truck represents the ruggedness of the five foot two Milbrett  who despite her small stature  has scored 86 career international goals  good for sixth best in world history   It also represents the outdoors woman and adventurer that she is  a small town Oregon girl who loves nature and travel  and who spent a good part of three years

other cars  takes curves like it was on rails and looks good doing it   It can go as fast as 165 miles an hour  Note to Oregon Highway Patrol  Tiffeny has never taken it that fast  as far as you know

statement about something in soccer that will be debated on by two individuals from the same walk of life  Be it a coach  player  general manager  the two will each give their side of the story  so to speak   In this case  we ve enlisted the help of two soccer journalists  In one corner  wearing a Mia Hamm replica jersey under his shirt and blue blazer     Jere Longman  who covers international sport and the Olympics for the New York Times and whose extensive coverage of the 1999 Women s World Cup turned into a book about the U S  Women s National Team entitled  The Girls of Summer   In the other corner  wearing a worn out replica of the now infamous U S  Men s  denim star  jersey     Steve Davis  a general columnist who s also been covering soccer for The Dallas Morning News for over a decade and has covered the last two Men s World Cups   This month s question  What event had a greater impact on soccer in the United States  World Cup   8216 94 or Women s World Cup   8216 99   Jere Longman  pro WWC99  It is indisputable that the 1999 Women s World Cup had a greater impact on soccer in the United States than the 1994 men s World Cup   The Women s World Cup produced an American champion  and the American public loves a winner  In three weeks  without benefit of lavish pre game shows or newspaper special sections  the Women s World Cup built a galvanizing momentum  It went from almost zero on the public radar to a consuming moment that drew over 90 000 fans to the final match against China at the Rose Bowl and attracted 40 million television viewers     Steve Davis  pro WC94  Back in the early 1990s  soccer was like the puny kid in junior high  lots of potential  plenty of good things ahead     but still the last one picked for the team and having some trouble fitting in   World Cup 1994 changed all that  It was international soccer s coming out party in the United States  A land that respects the big event  the colossal show  began to see soccer as a sport it could learn to like   For soccer fans  it was their moment in the sun  More importantly in the big picture  Americans who wouldn t know a corner kick from a corner market tuned in to see what the fuss was about  Until the United States wins a World Cup  nothing else will be more influential in elevating the sport s domestic profile   Continue  http   www ussoccer com news fullstory sps iNewsid

a winning chant for which hundreds of fans would eventually be asked to latch on to as their own was never going to be easy   Fans come in all different shapes and sizes   And so do stadium chants    From the long and melodic melodies of  We all root for the red soccer team  the red soccer team  the red soccer team   as sung to the lyrics of Yellow Submarine  to the less melodic but rhythmic eloquence of a European chant like  Stand up  if you hate Man U       Stand up  if you hate Man U    they each have their own charm   Continue  http   www ussoccer com news fullstory sps iNewsid 2470

Investors Cheer Earnings News By Peter Edmonston  10 22 2001 Dow Jones Business News  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc   The Wall Street Journal Online  Stocks rallied sharply Monday despite the widening anthrax scare  as a batch of better than expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 172 92  or 1 9   to close at 9377 03 after gaining 40 89 points Friday  The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36 75  or 2 2   to 1708 06 after climbing 18 59 points in the previous session   Other major stock indexes gained ground Monday  The Standard   Poor s 500 stock index added 16 42 to 1089 90  the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 7 13 to 561 45  and the Russell 2000 Index gained 4 80 to 430 50   Bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened   The stock market s gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in Washington  D C   was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation  Additionally  two other postal workers in Washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment   But stocks took the anthrax reports in stride  suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants  some analysts said Monday   The market is really shrugging off this news   said Mark Donahoe  a managing director at U S  Bancorp Piper Jaffray   Upbeat earnings news from American Express  released Monday afternoon  seemed to give stocks an additional lift   Investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and U S  military maneuvers in Afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results  said Steven Kroll Sr   managing director at Monness  Crepsi   Hardt   The uncertainty on the global front  looks like it is going to be a long  drawn out affair   Mr  Kroll said   I think stocks will revert back to being earnings driven    Although dismal by ordinary standards  last week s flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors  who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations   The markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings   said Mr  Donahoe of U S  Bancorp  That resilience might be giving hope to investors this week  he added   Still  investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up  Mr  Kroll argued   Third quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on Monday  with big companies such as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and U S  Steel posting results that met or topped analysts  estimates   The Dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p m  EDT when index component American Express reported earnings that  excluding certain items  beat Wall Street previously lowered estimates   The financial services concern posted net income of  298 million  or 22 cents a share  down 60  from  737 million  or 54 cents a share  a year earlier  Excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the September 11 attacks  American Express said it would have earned  595 million  or 45 cents a share  for the latest quarter  Analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share  according to Thomson Financial First Call   Shares of American Express surged after the quarterly earnings release  closing up 3 4  at  30 32   Chip stocks helped lead the Nasdaq composite higher  with the Philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5 4   The rally seemed to be a continuation of Friday s gains in the sector  sparked by positive earnings news from KLA Tencor   U S  Steel  the nation s No  1 steelmaker  said it swung to a third quarter loss from a profit a year earlier  hurt by oversupply and a weak economy  But excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another  U S  Steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial First Call  Shares of U S  Steel rose 9 7  to  14 74   Investors also sent 3M shares nearly 5  higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by Wall Street estimates  despite a 21  decline in net income  And oil producers Conoco and USX Marathon Group handily beat analysts  forecasts   But not all the earnings news was cheery  Local phone company SBC Communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates  Shares of SBC  a component of the Dow industrials  fell 5 1  to  41 40   Meanwhile  the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging  some analysts noted  On Monday  3M guided Wall Stret s earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter  and a top executive at U S  Steel told analysts that the company s fourth quarter would be  difficult    Companies  are meeting third quarter expectations  but they are talking down the fourth quarter   said Mr  Kroll of Monness Crespi   Hardt  He said that some of the rise in Monday s markets might be a carryover from Friday s buying activity related to the expiration of U S  stock option and index option contracts  an event known as  double witching    One of the hardest hit stocks on Monday was Enron  an energy concern that said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer  Shares of Enron plunged 21  to  20 65   Overseas  stocks closed higher  London s Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained 1 1   while Frankfurt s Xetra DAX index rose 2   Earlier in the day  Japan s Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0 3   but Hong Kong s Hang Seng Index ended 0 3  lower   In economic news  the Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0 5  in September  matching the estimates of economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets  The index    a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy    included some data gathered after the Sept  11 attacks   The decline  which was the index s largest one month drop since January 1996  confirmed that the widespread weakness in the U S  economy is deepening  the Conference Board said  Falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the September reading   In August  the leading indicators index slipped 0 1   less than the previous estimate of a 0 3  decline  Even so  the back to back declines paint a bleak economic picture  said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein   The two month decline in the index suggests that the already weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year  Mr  Goldstein said  The overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown   In major U S  market action   Stocks rose  On the Big Board  where 1 09 billion shares were traded  1 813 stocks rose and 1 291 fell  On the Nasdaq  1 49 billion shares changed hands   Bonds were mixed  The 10 year Treasury note rose less than 1 16 point Monday  or 62 5 cents for each  1 000 invested  The yield  which moves inversely to its price  fell to 4 618   The 30 year bond fell 1 16 point to yield 5 364    The dollar rose  The dollar bought 122 56 yen  compared with 121 20 yen late Friday  The euro traded at 89 18 U S  cents  down from 89 84 cents late Friday   Copyright  c  2001 Dow Jones   Company

Dow Jones   Company  Inc   NEW YORK   Dow Jones   A shareholder of Enron Corp   ENE  filed a derivative suit in Texas court alleging that Enron s board breached their fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships   In a press release Monday  a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said that Enron s board lost over  35 million by allowing Fastow to run these partnerships  which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest  The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets  permitting Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company s financial condition to earn millions of dollars   On Oct  16  Enron announced that it will take a  35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships and revealed that the company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships  thereby reducing the company s shareholder equity by  1 2 billion   On Monday  Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested additional information regarding the limited partnerships   On Oct  19  The Wall Street Journal reported that Fastow  and possibly a handful of partnership associates  realized more than  7 million last year in management fees and about  4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly  3 million in the partnership  which was set up in Dec  1999 principally to do business with Enron   Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years  which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments   Enron s New York Stock Exchange listed shares fell to a 52 week low on Monday following news that the SEC requested additional information   A spokeswoman from Enron said the company has not seen the lawsuit and it does not comment on pending litigation    Thomas Gryta  Dow Jones Newswires  201 938 5400

Oct 22  Reuters    Shares of Enron Corp  slumped more than 20 percent on Monday after it said U S  regulators are looking into company transactions  another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August   A spokesman for North America s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U S  Securities Exchange Commission  but said it was cooperating  The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry  Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron s chief financial officer  Andrew Fastow  The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years  and took  1 01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill fated investments   Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months at the helm   Enron shares declined  5 49  or 21 percent  to  20 56 in Monday afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange  shaving off almost  4 2 billion of its market capitalization  The stock  the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE  fell as much as 22 8 percent on Monday  when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998   Shares declined 23 percent last week after the Journal ran its first story about the limited partnerships on Wednesday   Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC s inquiry into  certain related party transactions  involved the partnerships    Related party transactions  is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships  LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co Investment LP  which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars   Fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in June  LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy related investments  and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy and communication related investments   The Journal reported  35 million of its third quarter loss of  638 million were connected with the limited partnerships  Curt Launer  an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston  said investors should question Enron s use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets   most notably in telecommunications   have declined precipitously    Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron s credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined   Launer said   Some analysts  though  cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke    This is an inquiry  not an investigation  and I cannot imagine Enron s attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal   said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey    It s easy for the market to kick a company when its down  but these challenges do not last for a solid company  and we think Enron is one    Shares in the company are down 75 percent

the New York Stock Exchange   The transactions took place in 1999 and 2000  according to Houston based Enron s 2000 annual report  They resulted in a dlrs 16 million pre tax gain to Enron in 1999 and a dlrs 36 million loss in 2000   Enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships  instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions    Enron entered into transactions with  limited partnerships  to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets   according to the section in the annual report   Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the SEC first contacted Enron last week and described the request is an  informal inquiry     This is not an investigation   he said   We see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us    SEC spokesman John Heine said he could not comment on the filings   We can t confirm or deny that type of activity   Heine said   The electricity marketer and natural

would  cooperate fully  with the commission   However  the company did not give any details of the transactions concerned or of the reasons behind the SEC s request   According to AG Edwards analyst Mike Heim  Enron  significantly reduced  its equity to unroll a partnership arrangement with a partially owned subsidiary formerly run by Enron s chief financial officer    This arrangement  which was not discussed in past SEC filings  has led to a growing distrust of the company by the financial community    In our opinion  the market is most likely overreacting to the news being disseminated over the last few days    However  we can give no assurances that all the problems at Enron have been fully disclosed   Heim said   In its statement this morning  Enron said although its internal and

Journal reported that a limited partnership organized by Andrew Fastow  Enron s chief financial officer  made millions in profits in transactions with the firm  The story cited information reported in an internal partnership document   Enron also said last week it will repurchase up to 55 million shares that it had issued as part of transactions with LJM2 CO Investment LP  the limited partnership created by Mr  Fastow   In addition  Enron took a  1 01 billion charge in the third quarter  mostly connected with write downs of bad investments  producing a loss of  618 million  or 84 cents a share  Excluding charges  income was  393 million  or 43 cents a share  in the quarter   The charge covers a wide range of items including costs related to the limited partnerships that were  until recently  by Mr  Fastow   The company said the costs connected with the partnerships total  35 million and involve the early termination of  certain structured finance arrangements    The partnerships were set up two years ago  and while the company maintains that they are perfectly proper  some have suggested that it is a conflict of interest for Enron s chief financial officer to be involved in a partnership that was looking to purchase Enron assets  the Journal reported   The energy company said its auditors reviewed the arrangements and its board was fully informed and approved the deals

Corp  s shares fell 21 percent after the Houston based company said the Securities and Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives        Enron  the largest energy trader  created partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its books  An investor sued Enron s board Wednesday  saying two partnerships cost the company  35 million and Fastow s leadership of them was a conflict of interest        Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in cash or stock  Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he may be have to   unravel   agreements that created the companies if Enron s debt ratings fall too far          We need confidence their long term credit rating won t go below investment grade    said Roger Hamilton  an analyst at John Hancock s value funds  which own

the Wall Journal reported last week        Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as  3 billion  Ray Niles  a Salomon Smith Barney analyst  wrote in a report to investors today        Enron shares fell  5 40 to  20 65  They touched  19 67 during the day s trading  the lowest level since Jan  15  1998                              Shares Plunge       The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about failed investments in trading of space on fiber optic communications networks and a water company  and the resignation of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job        While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons  investors say his departure led them to question whether the company was concealing problems  including possible liabilities from affiliated companies        On Tuesday  Enron surprised many investors when it reported a  618 million third quarter loss  the result of writing off  1 01 billion in failed investments         Moody s Investors Service placed the company s debt on watch for possible downgrade  The company s debt is rated at investment grade by Fitch  Standard   Poor s and Moody s        The company received a faxed request for information from the SEC on Wednesday asking for information  spokesman Mark Palmer said  and will respond   as soon as possible            We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest    Lay  who is also Enron s chairman  said in a statement                             Dilution Fears       Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing vehicles for its projects  based on filings with the Texas secretary of state  Fastow and other Enron executives are named as the controlling partners or the board members in the companies        Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants  removing the debt for those projects from Enron s books  That allows Enron to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting what it views as secondary businesses  Standard   Poor s debt analyst Todd Shipman said         Enron brokers trades of electricity  natural gas and other commodities as well as owns power plants and natural gas pipelines        Dismantling the affiliates would be costly  Whitewing Management  an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power plants and lists Fastow as managing director  holds 250 000 preferred shares of Enron        Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit rating drops below investment grade  according to company filings  That would dilute the value of common shareholders  investment          The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are out there    Shipman said    Investors are worried they might have to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they originally thought                             Worrisome Financing       Enron s auditors and attorneys reviewed the company s   related party arrangements    the board approved them  and they were disclosed in SEC filings  Enron said in its statement        That hasn t eased concerns  The reduction of shareholder equity by  1 2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to worry about Enron s other financing vehicles  wrote Niles  the Salomon analyst  Enron also may take another  2 4 billion in losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and projects in South America  he wrote        Enron s 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell  34 per  1 000 face value to be offered at  1 022 today from  1 056 on Friday  traders said  Yield on the debt rose to 7 33 percent from 6 33 percent        Based on Bloomberg composite ratings  most of Enron s long  term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1  two or three levels above investment grade        Fastow continues to work  and Enron hasn t punished him  Palmer said  Fastow declined to be interviewed  spokeswoman Karen Denne said  SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the agency s request to Enron

 LONDON  Oct 11  Reuters    Blue blooded banker N M Rothschild   Sons Ltd said on Thursday it would shut down its base metals trading operations except in Australia   the third base metals trader this week to announce cutbacks   Rothschild remains firmly committed to its precious metals activity  however  company managing director and group treasurer Geoffrey Spice told Reuters  The company  the merchant banking arm and UK branch of the Rothschild family s financial empire  chairs the twice daily benchmark price setting London gold fix    In light of difficult trading conditions in the base metals markets  we have concluded that our limited base metals operation is no longer viable   company Chairman Sir Evelyn de Rothschild said in a statement    We ve been reviewing the situation for quite some time  We ve found that trading conditions  in base metals  have been difficult and opportunities have been limited   Spice said   Rothschild would not be taking on any new positions in base metals but would see existing positions on its books through to fruition  according to clients  wishes  he said   Rothschild is a category 2  associate broker clearing  member of the London Metal Exchange  LME   the company would maintain its LME membership while existing positions run their course and would review it in due course  Spice said   The move to exit base metals will involve the closure of Rothschild s metals sales desk in New York and a number of redundancies in the London and New York trading  sales and support areas  the company said   Employees were informed of the decision on Thursday afternoon  around 20 Rothschild staff in total would be affected by the move  Spice said   The company s Australian base metals activities would continue as normal  however  he added    Australia has a very strong franchise and will continue to operate in the base metals market   he said   The Rothschild move follows news this week that the Bank of Nova Scotia will scale back its base metals trading desk and that Enron Metals plans to cut around 10 percent of staff as a part of a Europe wide job cut programme   Base metals traders have been struggling in recent months in the face of falling business volumes and sagging metals prices as continuing economic gloom and uncertainty after the September 11 attacks on the United States leave buyers sidelined   PRECIOUS METALS STRONG  Spice stressed  however  that the company s precious metals operations would continue as normal    We have a very strong position in precious metals which will not be affected in any way   he said    N M Rothschild remains strongly committed to our core business in precious metals and continues to be at the forefront of spot  forward and option bullion markets and a leading member

10 11 2001 Reuters English News Service  C  Reuters Limited 2001   BOMBAY  Oct 11  Reuters    The Indian unit of U S  energy major Enron Corp   said on Thursday it had obtained a ruling from a London court preventing a provincial government from legally challenging international arbitration proceedings   Enron s Indian unit  Dabhol Power Company  has taken a local Indian utility to the International Court of Arbitration in London for a breach of contract  The utility  the Maharashtra State Electricity Board  had signed a contract to buy the output from Dabhol s  2 9 billion power plant on the western coast of India  It later said it did not need all the power from the 2 184 MW plant  and that it was too expensive   But a local regulatory authority  the Maharashtra State Electricity Commission  said the power company s dispute with the utility fell within its ambit  and that Dabhol could not proceed with the arbitration  This sparked a round of litigation  which is now at a stage where the Bombay High Court must decide whether Dabhol can take the dispute to London   In order to prevent more litigation  Enron obtained an injunction from the Commercial Court in London which restrains the government of Maharashtra  which owns the utility  from also filing a suit in India challenging the international arbitration proceedings    Over the past few months  the government of Maharashtra and other government entities have taken actions to avoid complying with their contractual obligations   Dabhol said in a statement received late on Thursday   This has frustrated the rights of international investors that were legally agreed to by the relevant parties several years ago    Government officials were not be reached for comment   Copyright   2000 Dow

 Reuters    Anglo Energy  Enron and Rio Energy agreed to match the price of  6 97 below West Texas Intermediate  WTI  for Ecuador crude contracts for November  a Petroecuador official said Thursday   Petroecuador last week retendered eight three month crude contracts  each for 12 000 barrels per day  bpd   following a price dispute with former contract holders that led Ecuador s state oil company to break the contracts  The company awarded Coastal Petroleum two contracts on Friday at WTI minus  6 97  with a floor price for WTI at  20 per barrel  and offered other interested companies the chance to match this price for November   Petroecuador will set the price of Ecuador s crude for December and January   Anglo Energy will take two contracts while Enron and Rio Energy will take one contract each  the official said on the condition of anonymity   It was not immediately clear what would happen to two crude contracts sought by Glencore  Glencore had yet to respond to the offer on

PIPELINE PLAN David Fleshler Staff Writer  10 11 2001 South Florida Sun Sentinel Broward Metro 3B  Copyright 2001 by the Sun Sentinel   A proposal to build a natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas to Broward County drew harsh reviews Wednesday from an audience in Dania Beach   Not a single speaker spoke in favor of the project  although one or two were neutral  during a public workshop held by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission at the I T  Parker Community Center   It is totally insane to put a high pressure natural gas pipeline through such a densely populated area   said Susan Epps  of Oakland Park   The loss of life and property if there would be an accident would be catastrophic    The commission is preparing an environmental impact statement for the project  More workshops will be held once a draft is ready  The process is expected to take several months   Enron Corp  of Houston proposed the pipeline as a way to meet the state s growing demand for natural gas  a relatively clean and increasingly popular fuel for power plants  Two other companies have made similar proposals   Enron s representatives say construction of the pipeline would do minimal damage to the coral reefs in its path  And it is an extremely safe way to transport natural gas   But few people in the audience saw it that way   Dan Clark  a member of a Broward County group that monitors the health of coral reefs  said that the company s representatives painted too rosy a picture of the project s impact on coral reefs by claiming that drilling a path under the reefs would leave them unharmed    What they failed to tell you is that they re going to have to assemble the pipe across the second reef and drag it across the second reef   he said   At a time when we re losing these habitats  we don t want to lose any more  willingly    Some speakers questioned the wisdom of bringing in another source of fossil fuels  however clean it may be  rather than putting more effort in conservation and renewable energy    Why don t we regulate people s use of energy   asked Judy Kuchta  of North Beach in Hollywood   Why do people have to waste energy playing stupid video games and watching mindless TV    Several speakers worried about the project s effects on John U  Lloyd State Park  a popular beachfront park under which the pipeline would run    The park simply can t sustain the additional degradation of pipeline construction and operation   said Sara Case  speaking for Save Our Shoreline  a Hollywood conservation group   The beach is one of Broward County s most important sea turtle nesting areas  Shore birds are attracted to the park  We simply find it difficult to believe that significant environmental damage is not inevitable from this monumental project    David Fleshler can

restructuring to enhance our cash position  stren  gthen our balance sheet and address upcoming maturities   said chief financ  ial officer Jeffrey McMahon  20 Enron first informed investors of the possibility it would be forced to rep  ay the 690 mln usd note in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commissi  on on Monday  20 The obligation arose after Standard   Poor s cut the company s long term de  bt rating to BBB  last week  forcing it to either post collateral on the no  te or repay it on maturity  20 Enron said it has also secured the remaining 450 mln usd of a previously an

Sachs   Co  analyst David Fleischer   became the latest to question Enron s future  saying that an SEC filing by   the Houston based company earlier this week  raised new issues about liqui  dity and the ability of the company to even finance itself over the next se  veral months   Analysts are also questioning whether Dynegy Inc  s planned dlrs 8 9 billio  n acquisition of Enron will survive

willing to roll current maturities over   and even make new equity investments  20 Michelle Foss  director of the Energy Institute at the University of Housto  n  said this latest round of troubles

als  o said that it had agreed with its bankers to draw down the remaining  450   million of a previously announced  1 billion secured credit line that has J   P  Morgan Chase as its lead banker  20 Investors have been fleeing Enron since the company last month disclosed a    1 2 billion writedown to unwind some related party hedging transactions  T  he Securities and Exchange Commission is probing Enron deals with related p  arties  The October disclosure made investors uneasy because it suggested t  he company hadn t been forthcoming about the true state of its finances  an  d it showed that Enron was facing serious liquidity problems  20 Those fears were temporarily quieted earlier this month when Enron agreed t  o be acquired by smaller rival Dynegy  But Enron s disclosure Monday that i  t faces additional earnings and financing troubles renewed the rush to the   exits  In the Wednesday release  Enron CEO Ken Lay said his company was sti  ll committed to the merger   We continue to believe that this merger is in   the best interests of our shareholders  employees and lenders   Dynegy late  r issued a press release indicating it is  continuing our confirmatory due

slightly higher after the midday press release t  o trade at  4 90  Enron shares have lost more than 80  of their value since   the company issued its third quarter earnings release last month  Dynegy d  ropped  2 44  to  39 26  though it remains substantially above premerger le  vels  20 At the heart of Enron s trouble is the sense that the company isn t letting   on the full extent of its troubles  The selloff in Enron shares began in e  arnest Oct  16  when the company disclosed in an earnings conference call t  hat it would take a  1 2 billion writedown to unwind some related party tra  nsactions  Critics of the company said those deals  in which the company di  d business with separate entities involving Enron managers  raised serious   ethical and disclosure issues  20 The Dynegy merger was taken as a vote of confidence for Enron  since as a b  ig trading partner Dynegy would appear to have a solid grasp of Enron s sit  uation  As a result  shares in both companies rallied after the deal s anno  uncement  But Monday s disclosure that Enron faced  690 million in bond pay  ments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges   than it has detailed  According to a Merrill Lynch report cited in The New   York Times Wednesday  Dynegy wasn t aware of the  690 million obligation    Critics of the deal wondered whether Enron had told Dynegy about all its ob  ligations   http   www thestreet com markets detox 10003860 html  20 Liquidity fears have also been rekindled by information contained in a fili  ng of quarterly results that show the company consumed as much as  5 billio  n of cash in recent weeks  By the end of 2002  Enron has to find around  9   billion to pay back various obligations  It had  1 2 billion in cash on han  d as of Nov  16  according to the filing  20 Tellingly  Dynegy shares haven t plunged along with Enron  suggesting that   investors see a collapse of the merger as catastrophic for Enron but not fo  r Dynegy  At current levels  Enron shares are trading at more than a 50  di  scount to the Dynegy offer  20 J P  Morgan has taken a leading role in helping Enron  It has lent funds an  d it helped

officer  in a statement   J P  Morgan Chase  amp  Co  said it and other lenders are committed to helping Enron improve its financial position   Also  Enron reaffirmed its commitment to a merger with

of Marlin Water Trust II s  Marlin II s  approximately  915 million senior secured notes due 2003  and Osprey Trust s  Osprey s  approximately  2 4 billion senior secured notes due 2003 on Rating Watch Negative  The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes are currently rated  BBB   This rating action follows the placing of Enron Corp  s ratings on Rating Watch Negative by Fitch   The rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund account  pre funded interest  and equity commitment from Enron in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock  The overfund account is invested in Enron debt securities  rated  BBB    Rating Watch Negative   with payments used to service interest to noteholders  Payment of principal ultimately relies on Enron s obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred securities  Fitch currently rates Enron s preferred securities  BBB    Rating Watch Negative  In addition  the transaction also benefits from rights under a  125 million loan to Azurix Europe Limited  rated  BBB   by Fitch   Similarly  the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the support from the assets in the share trust used to support interest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund principal payments  The mandatorily convertible preferred stock has been issued and is being held in the share trust  The assets in the share trust supporting interest payments include Enron unsecured obligations  the overfund account  as well as quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible preferred stock   While various sources of repayment exist  such as sale or liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering  in each case primary credit support is derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee the 120 day prior to the maturity date  which is one of the Note Trigger Events  In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes  Enron is required to deliver additional shares  If Enron cannot or does not deliver on this obligation  subject to certain standstill periods  then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of Enron  representing a general unsecured claim  Additional Note Trigger Events include a downgrade of Enron s senior unsecured debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies in conjunction with specified declines in Enron s closing stock price over three consecutive trading days  as well as customary events of default under the notes  It is important to note that Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt   Fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction with the ratings of Enron  Corp  and will update investors as appropriate    Enron s Debt Falls As Company Draws Down On Bank Loans  10 26 2001 Capital Markets Report  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    NEW YORK   Dow Jones   Enron Corp  s  ENE  bond and bank debt was quoted lower early Friday following the Houston energy giant s decision Thursday to draw down about  3 billion on its bank loan facilities   Late Thursday  Enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community  Specifically  the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of  1 billion  Enron s 6 4  bonds which come due in July 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar  down from around 82 cents on Thursday   Trading activity in investment grade bank debt like that of Enron s isn t as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment grade ratings  But fixed income sources noted some offers Friday for Enron s bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar  still well above distressed levels  They add that banks may want to try to sell Enron s bank debt  which is now funded following the drawdown  but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago   That was well before Enron ran into its current market turmoil  Last week  the company reported a  618 million third quarter loss and  1 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity  The company has said that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with Andrew S  Fastow  its former chief financial officer who was replaced on Wednesday   Moody s Investors Service rates Enron s senior unsecured debt at Baa1  though it s on review for a possible downgrade  Fitch Inc  and Standard   Poor s both rate the debt triple B plus  Fitch also has Enron s debt on review for a possible downgrade  while S P changed Enron s credit outlook to negative from stable   Enron s stock was trading at around  15 87  down 48 cents at around 12 20 p m  EDT   Among the Enron bank debt that comes due in May 2002 is a  1 75 billion 364 day commercial paper backstop facility  The company also has a  1 25 billion revolving facility that s due in April 2005  according to Loan Pricing Corp  in New York   One distressed debt investor said some of the bank debt comes with a low coupon of around 55 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate   Banks  the investor said   are funding it and not getting paid for the risk at Libor plus 55  even though it comes due in May  02   the investor said   Another fixed income official said that trading desks may start to kick the tires on Enron s bank debt  given the run of fallen angels  or investment grade companies that have been downgraded to below investment grade status  within the last year  Among such companies are Lucent Technologies Inc   LU  and Xerox Corp   XRX    As soon as banks have a piece of paper they never expected to be funded  it really changes their perception and some just want to get this stuff off their books   this person said   Some banks  though  may not be active seller of Enron s debt given that banks  business with big investment grade companies is relationship driven    Banks are not very quick to pull out of a relationship like that   the fixed income official said     By Joe Niedzielski  Dow Jones Newswires  201 938 2039  joe niedzielski dowjones com  Copyright   2000 Dow Jones

Jones   Company  Inc    HOUSTON   Dow Jones   In a July conference call with analysts when Jeff Skilling was still chief executive of Enron Corp   ENE   he threw out a ray of hope for his company s foundering broadband business   Enron Broadband Services had just signed a long term deal to provide bandwidth for MSN  Microsoft Corp  s  MSFT  online Internet service  Skilling said  Enron would give more details on the deal later  After three months without farther word on the deal  Enron has broken its silence by suing Microsoft   In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County  Texas  Enron claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal   The agreement  signed June 25  called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide network capacity and other services to support Microsoft s offering of high speed Internet service  according to the lawsuit   Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the deal  according to the lawsuit   Microsoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal  so Enron isn t required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal  the lawsuit said    Microsoft sent Enron a letter dated Oct  23 saying that if Enron didn t provide an operational broadband system by Oct  25  Enron would have breached the contract  the lawsuit said  Microsoft then would be entitled to recover damages   The suit also said Microsoft failed to provide monthly subscriber growth forecast required by the deal   In a third breach of the contract  the suit claimed  Microsoft made public announcements about the subject of the agreement without getting Enron s prior approval   An Enron official told Dow Jones Newswires that Microsoft had issued a press release Oct  15 about the service but that Enron wasn t mentioned in the release   A Microsoft news release dated Oct  15 announced what the company calls MSN 7  a new version of the MSN network which includes high speed  or broadband  access to the Web  The service was to be available on Oct  25   The Microsoft release said MSN 7 would deliver  state of the art  video and audio through  dramatically improved  broadband technology  The new service would extend MSN broadband service  to more than 29 million households in 45 markets    By the end of the first quarter of 2002  the Microsoft release said  the MSN broadband service would be available to more than 90  of U S  households capable of using high speed digital subscriber line access   The Enron lawsuit asked that Microsoft be declared in breach of contract  It also asked that Enron be allowed to recover unspecified damages as well as costs stemming from the lawsuit   Neither Enron nor Microsoft have responded to requests for comment on the lawsuit   The Microsoft deal is the second failed broadband agreement  In July 2000  Enron and Blockbuster Video  a unit of Viacom Inc   VIA   announced a deal to deliver movies over the Internet   That deal fell apart in March of this year when Blockbuster said Enron s fiber optic network couldn t deliver the service on a dependable basis  Enron countered that Blockbuster couldn t deliver the quality and quantity of movies needed for a successful video on demand service    By Michael Rieke  Dow Jones Newswires  713 547

Krasner  Globe Staff  10 26 2001 The Boston Globe THIRD C 1  Copyright 2001   The retail sales subsidiary of Houston energy giant Enron Corp  faced expulsion last week from the New England group representing power generators  marketers and distributors  The sales unit had failed to meet bonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group itself from unpaid bills   ISO New England  which operates the power grid throughout the six New England states  urged Nepool  the power industry group  to  initiate termination proceedings  for Enron Energy Services Inc   according to a letter obtained by the Globe  An Enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied Nepool s requirements  and blamed the threatening letter on a series of administrative oversights  including the failure of ISO New England to warn Enron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels    It was an administrative snafu   said Peggy Mahoney  a spokeswoman for Enron   It s fixed  It s no big deal  We didn t get the paperwork in  on time  because it got sent to the wrong desk  It was taken care of on Friday    According to the letter  a Nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 months   Having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently   said Ellen Foley  an ISO New England spokeswoman  In the letter  ISO s chief financial officer  Edward McKenna  said his organization  has been in contact with Enron Energy Services through multiple telephone communications  and to date the financial assurance has not been cured    But Mahoney said Enron never received written notification of its previous  financial assurance  defaults  which were corrected almost immediately  Therefore  she said  the company was unaware that the current default was the third  which begins the expulsion proceeding  In addition  she said  the current default notice was sent to the wrong person  creating the delay that resulted in the letter   We re working with ISO New England to figure that out   she said   The recommended termination is an embarrassment to Enron because the firm s director of state government affairs  Daniel W  Allegretti  is the chairman of Nepool s Participant Committee  which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization    This is not that unusual within the pool   said Allegretti   I frequently receive notices of technical defaults   As far as posting the new bond to correct the situation  he said   We were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork    The incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Enron  The parent in Houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm s chief financial officer  Andrew S  Fastow  is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with Enron  The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing those transactions  the company said Monday  Enron placed Fastow on leave Tuesday and installed a new CFO   Enron s stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company s financial strength  The company reduced shareholder equity by  1 2 billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by Fastow  according to The Wall Street Journal  Enron lost  618 million in the third quarter   Yesterday  Enron s shares closed at  16 35  down 6 cents  on volume of 39 1 million shares   Jeffrey Krasner can be reached by e mail at krasner globe com   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved     FRONT PAGE   COMPANIES   MARKETS  Enron s explanations fail to quell critics  concerns  Financial Times  Oct 26  2001 By JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY  Enron has put up a page on its website of  frequently asked questions  in response to a barrage of analysts  enquiries following last week s controversial results announcement   Unfortunately  the US energy group s critics have not been satisfied with the answers  Nor has Wednesday s decision to replace Andrew Fastow  its chief financial officer  quelled all investors  concerns about its highly complex financial affairs   However  analysts are pleased that Kenneth Lay  chief executive officer  is distancing the group from Mr Fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle  partnerships    It is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move   says Ronald Barone of UBS Warburg   It s not the end of it    The shares  which have tumbled since last week s results  ended a shade lower yesterday  off 0 37 per cent at Dollars 16 35  But analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the 52 week high of Dollars 84 87 until the group improves its transparency   One of the frequently asked questions following Enron s results announcement on October 16 concerned  a Dollars 1 2bn  Pounds 840m  reduction in shareholders  equity   The Dollars 1 2bn was not explained in the news release on the results  but mentioned in passing by Mr Lay in a follow up conference call  Many analysts confused it with a Dollars 1 01bn charge in the earnings report   It has since been called a  loss  and a  write off  and Enron s staff have struggled to explain it in plain language   Enron s official position now is that the reduction in shareholders  equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which LJM  a private equity fund formed by Mr Fastow  was an investor  When the decision was made to terminate these vehicles  Enron  recorded a Dollars 1 2bn reduction in shareholders  equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables  These adjustments were the result of Enron s termination of obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods    The confusion over the Dollars 1 2bn has further undermined the credibility of Enron  which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission   Analysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group s debt ratio  which might hurt its debt rating   Mr Lay held an analysts  meeting to counter charges that Enron was not transparent  But this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts   I find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions   said Goldman Sachs  David Fleischer   Other analysts are also concerned about potential further write offs  Salomon Smith Barney s Raymond Niles points to Enron s investments in its Dabhol Indian power plant  its South American investments  and its remaining telecoms assets  Most importantly  he says  they may include several of Enron s other off balance sheet vehicles    Frankly  we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them   Mr Niles says  Other US energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival  El Paso said it was facing  a lot of questions on its accounting practices    Additional reporting by Julie Earle Enron in turmoil  www ft com enron  Copyright  The Financial Times Limited   Enron Bonds Fall as Company

Houston  Oct  26  Bloomberg     Enron Corp  bonds and shares fell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond rating wouldn t be lowered and tapped a  3 billion credit line because it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets        Enron s stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days after investors questioned the company s transactions with affiliated companies run by its former chief financial officer  The stock fell 45 cents to  15 90 in early afternoon trading today          People are questioning the credibility of management    said John Cassady  who helps manage  3 billion of fixed income assets at Fifth Third Bancorp    It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the benefit of himself          Enron is shut out of commercial paper markets  where short  term loans carry lower rates than banks offer  The company will use its credit line to pay off  2 2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding  Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said         The company s 6 3 4 percent bonds which mature in 2009 declined 1 1 2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents  At that price  the bonds  which carry a rating of   BBB     yield 9 53 percent        Enron s shares have dropped as investors grew concerned that the company s credit rating will be cut after  1 01 billion in third quarter losses from failed investments  Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions                             Dilution Concerns       Though Enron s bonds have investment grade ratings  their yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds that carry junk ratings  According to Bloomberg data  companies with   BB   ratings pay on average 9 16 percent to borrow for seven years        A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back holdings in other partnerships with its stock  diluting the value of Enron investors  stock        Partnerships called Whitewing  Marlin and Yosemite own Enron assets they bought with borrowed money  Enron sold the assets to the partnerships to keep debt related to them off its books  The partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the assets        If Enron loses investment grade rating  the borrowed money comes due earlier  leaving less time for the partnerships to find the best price for the power plants and other assets  Enron would have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell for and the amount of the debt        One way would be issuing common shares in exchange for Enron preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships  That would thin out the holding of every other investor        Of the two main bond rating companies  Moody s Investors Service has the company on watch for possible downgrade  and Standard   Poor s lowered Enron s long term credit outlook to negative  Egan Jones Rating Co  today lowered its rating on Enron s debt to BB   one notch below investment grade  from BBB                             Other Liabilities       Enron s liabilities associated with the partnerships amounts to at least  3 3 billion  the company has said        Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost the company  35 million in direct losses  Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the partnership  reducing shareholder equity by  1 2 billion

the  wash   sale  rule can be a hurdle  because it essentially prevents taxpayers from   selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring  substantially i  dentical  securities within a 30 day period before or after that loss  This   poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri  ces now make them attractive  buy  candidates  20 In addition  the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w  ash sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in the money pu  t  because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir  ed by the investor  20 So investors typically get around the wash sale rule by  doubling up   buyi  ng additional stock or options  waiting at least 31 days  and then selling   the original stock to book the loss  Investors double up by buying calls  w  hich locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying addi  tional stock   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc

Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp   Dynegy Inc  is   coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult  ibillion dollar deal  20 The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh  ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy trading comp  any  the nation s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas  During t  he past month  Enron has taken a  1 billion write off of assets  revised do  wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a  1 2 billion redu  ction in shareholder equity  The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn  erships  run by some of its own executives  under investigation by the Secu  rities and Exchange Commission  In an SEC filing Monday  Enron disclosed hu  ndreds of millions of potential additional write offs as well as the possib  ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t  han  2 billion in loans by the end of the year  20 As of 4 p m  Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading  Enron   shares fell  1 98  or 28   to  5 01 each after having dropped 23  Tuesday    In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday  more than four times the   volume of any other Big Board stock  Enron s bonds also again traded sharpl  y lower  market observers said  20 The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy s stock  which also was among the most a  ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange  As of 4 p m  Wednesday  Dyne  gy shares fell  1 94 to  39 76 each  20 On Wednesday  Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi  ve Chuck Watson said his company was working  to accelerate the regulatory   approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously   announced agreement  though it continued to perform  due diligence  on Enr  on  20 Under the merger agreement  Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk   away from the deal if Enron s financial and legal problems become severe e  nough  However  some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so   called material adverse change clauses  They point to a decision earlier th  is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc  to c  omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc  even though Tyson  a Springdale  Ark     food products company  had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a   drop in IBP s earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit  20 Dynegy officials didn t return calls seeking comment  To complete the deal    two thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou  ld have to give their approval  No dates for those votes have been set  20 One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr  on contained information Dynegy hadn t known about  Dynegy representatives   planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i  nformation as part of the company s due diligence  this person said  It cou  ldn t be determined what the new information was  20 The merger agreement  announced Nov  9  calls for Dynegy to exchange 0 2685   share for each of Enron s roughly 850 million fully diluted shares  giving   the purchase a value of about  9 billion at Dynegy s current stock price    However  from a price standpoint  the deal is appearing less attractive to   Dynegy  20 On the day of the merger announcement  Enron shares were trading at about    8 63 each  or about 83  of the purchase price under the exchange ratio  As   of Wednesday  Enron s market price was only about 47  of the merger formula   price  Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme  nt  when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra  ding relatively close to the offering price  20 Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger  In  itially  many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron   and provide a major boost to Houston based Dynegy  Dynegy and Enron officia  ls have predicted that the merger  supposed to be completed late next year    would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy s earnings  20 Now analysts are challenging that assumption  Ron Barone  managing director   at UBS Warburg LLC  said he believes that because of Enron s financial pro  blems  a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than   Dynegy would have by itself  Mr  Barone said he thinks a  likely scenario    is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0 15   Dynegy share for each Enron share  20 Such a ratcheting down wouldn t be without precedent in the deal  According   to one person familiar with the merger negotiations  Dynegy reduced the ex  change formula at least once prior to the Nov  9 announcement because of En  ron s rapidly sinking stock price  which at the beginning of this year was   above  80 a share  20 In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street  Go  ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy    A longtime Enron fan  Mr  Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha  t the merger would help Dynegy s earnings and whether Enron could  recover   the significant business that has been lost  in its giant energy trading op  erations   The Enron machine continues to sputter   Mr  Fleischer wrote  20 Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren  egotiate the terms significantly  Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy l  aw filing  Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba  nkers and customers  an Enron bankruptcy court filing  is highly possible     said Ralph Pellecchia  a senior director at Fitch  a credit ratings agency    On Wednesday  Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not  ch above noninvestment grade  or  junk   status  But Fitch also said it bel  ieved Enron s trading partners had made  significant cash collateral calls    in recent days that are  well in excess of previous expectations   contrib  uting to  liquidity pressures   20 Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir  m of Weil  Gotshal   Manges  which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate   workout situations  Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing  an Enron spok  eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor  e doesn t expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger  Since the m  erger announcement  Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt  ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them  Enron sa  id it made some progress improving its financial position  The company said   it reached a final agreement with units of J P  Morgan Chase   Co  and Cit  igroup Inc  on the remaining  450 million of a previously announced  1 bill  ion in secured credit lines  Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym  ent of an existing  690 million note to mid December from next week  The sp  okeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet  ed next month so that repayment wouldn t be required this year  20     20 Thaddeus Herrick and Robin Sidel contributed to this article

2001 The Wall Street Journal C1  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    Enron Corp   the embattled Houston energy and trading company  has been sue  d by members of its employee retirement plan  which has suffered losses bec  ause of Enron s plummeting stock price  20 Two separate lawsuits  filed in federal court in Houston  allege Enron misl  ed participants in its 401 k  retirement plan about the risks of investing   in the company s shares and note that the company forced the employees to r  emain invested in its stock even as the shares fell  Amid growing disclosur  es of financial problems in recent weeks  the company  locked down  the ret  irement plan from Oct  17 to Nov  19 to make administrative changes  which   prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed  Enron  which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc   Houston  becaus  e of mounting financial problems  has seen its stock price fall to  5 01 on   Wednesday from a peak of nearly  90 a share last year  The decline has bee  n costly to participants in Enron s retirement plan because more than 60  o  f the 401 k  assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year    according to one of the suits  20 The first suit was filed Nov  13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell   Harrison   Wright LLP  a Houston law firm  and the second was filed Tuesda  y by Seattle based Hagens Berman LLP  Both seek class action certification    20 Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits  A sp  okeswoman also said the company s 401 k  plan offers participants 18 invest  ment choices  one of which is company stock  20 The company s stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it   had extensive off balance sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed   by former company officials  The Securities and Exchange Commission has la  unched a formal investigation into the company s accounting  and Enron has   said it will restate years of financial information  20 The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c  ompanies over losses in the company stock portion of their 401 k  plans  Th  e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu  ing to offer company stock  even after they became aware of serious busines  s problems that would hurt the stock price  All the suits are pending  20 As with most of these companies  Enron matches employee contributions to th  e 401 k  with shares of Enron stock  and also offers Enron stock as an inve  stment choice  in addition to a variety of mutual funds  About  1 3 billion   of the plan s  2 1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the e  nd of 2000  according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison  20 Pamela Tittle  a participant in the 401 k  plan who worked in the finance d  epartment and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harriso  n   Wright  had roughly 2 000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement accou  nt and has suffered losses of about  140 000 as a result of the stock s dec  line  The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401 k  plan violated   their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company   stock was in peril  20 The suit filed by Hagens Berman  also alleges that the company failed to wa  rn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock  In additi  on  it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial result  s since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the   SEC  20 Roy E  Rinard  a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in th  e suit filed by Hagens Berman  has seen the value of his retirement plan fa  ll to  70 000 from  470 000  largely as a result of the decline in Enron s   stock   I feel like I have been betrayed   Mr  Rinard said in press release   issued by his lawyers   I lost my savings  my plans for the future  everyt  hing   20 Under federal pension law  companies are allowed to offer their own stock i  n retirement plans  and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto  ck  Enron doesn t let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat  ching contributions to the 401 k  plan until age 50  20 However  plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes  ts of the participants  which includes choosing prudent investments  Genera  lly  to prove that the plan s administrators breached their fiduciary dutie  s  employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen  t  This presents a high hurdle  so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits   over losses in company stock in 401 k  plans have generally come in the wa  ke of allegations of accounting irregularities  20 Lynn Sarko  one of Ms  Tittle s attorneys with Seattle s Keller Rohrback LL  P  is also co lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies   Inc   Murray Hill  N J  Another firm representing Ms  Tittle is Dalton Got  to Samson   Kilgard PLC  which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ik  on Office Solutions Inc   Malvern  Pa  The two law firms are representing M  s  Tittle with Campbell Harrison   Wright  20 The suits against Lucent and Ikon  like the suit against Enron  allege that   then current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite   knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price  Repr  esentatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn t require employee  s to invest in the company stock  and educated employees about the need for   diversification  20 The suit in which Mr  Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct  17  a day afte  r Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling  1   01 billion in the third quarter  Enron  locked down  the 401 k  plan s asse  ts  preventing participants from selling Enron shares   A  lock down  occur  s when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another    and generally lasts several weeks  during which time participants can t mak  e changes in their investment choices   20 The lock down was lifted on Nov  19  In the interim  on Nov  8  Enron annou  nced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results   from 1997 through 2000  By the time the lock down was lifted  as a result o  f all the negative news the shares had fallen to below  9 a share from  32   20 on Oct  17  when the lockup started  Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth s  aid  20  They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announci  ng some really bad news   Mr  Barth said   Mr  Rinard s looking at having n  o retirement savings now  It s a horrible thing to have to start over in yo  ur 50s    Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved   09  Business Financial Desk  Section C From Sunbeam to Enron  Andersen s Reputation Suffers By FLOYD NORRIS  11 23 2001 The New York Times Page 1  Column 2 c  2001 New York Times Company  THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen  the accounting firm   that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry  The Securities   and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p  artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem  ent case  20 Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar  thur Andersen  in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from   the company s reported profits in recent years  All of which raises the question  Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee  p of the accounting industry  20 It is not an easy question to answer  and not everyone is willing to rush t  o judgment    If you want to attack Andersen for Enron  you need to know mo  re than we know    Arthur Levitt  the former chairman of the Securities and   Exchange Commission  said this week  20 But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases  it   is materiality  In all three cases  Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti  ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea  d  20 Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into   trouble  The idea is that it doesn t much matter if a few little things we  re gotten wrong  But they can add up  20 At Enron  however  they did not add up to that much    a total of  93 milli  on over four years  The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel  ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated  It is not cle  ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time  20 To those who treasure the role of auditors  the humiliation of Andersen is   painful  Back in the 1950 s  it was Leonard Spacek  Andersen s managing par  tner  who warned that   the profession s existence is in peril   because it   was not showing enough independence  His public prodding was crucial in ma  king the industry do a better job  Two decades ago  when the issue on the t  able was pension accounting  Andersen was the only major accounting firm to   break with clients and push for good rules  20 Now Andersen s backbone is open to question  It was evidence that senior pe  ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that   led the S E C  to bring that suit  which the firm chose to settle without a  dmitting it had done anything wrong  The partner that the S E C  says looke  d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations  and Andersen says h  e acted properly  20 Lynn Turner  who was chief accountant of the S E C  at the time and is now   director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un  iversity  says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap  pened to Coopers   Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s  eries of highly publicized blown audits  20   We got bludgeoned to death in the press    he said    People did not even   want to see us at their doorsteps  It was brutal  but we deserved it  We h  ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls      By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending   clients and not enough to good accounting  20 For Andersen to avoid that fate  its relatively new chief executive  Joseph   Berardino  who declined to be interviewed for this column  will need to se  t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the   backbone that Mr  Spacek epitomized  And then he will have to convince the   public of that   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved   09

New York Times Company  When William B  Harrison Jr  speaks of last year s  31 billion merger of J    P  Morgan and the Chase Manhattan Corporation  he speaks proudly of a deal   that he considers to be a capstone to his 34 year career of helping build   a giant of the banking business  20   This is the first merger I ve been part of    said Mr  Harrison  the chie  f executive of the combined bank    where I feel our core business is compl  ete    The Chase J  P  Morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investm  ent banking elite  just as Mr  Harrison intended  But with Wall Street and   the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was   put together  the many mergers  stock sales and other money making opportun  ities that were supposed to justify the high priced acquisition have largel  y dried up for now  20 Consequently  deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already spec  ulating that Mr  Harrison  58  may ultimately be compelled to do yet anothe  r large deal  this time to diversify his business away from its heavy empha  sis on Wall Street  20 J  P  Morgan Chase has won some prominent assignments  like handling the re  vampings of troubled giants like Lucent and  more recently  Enron  the bele  aguered energy trading company  20 But while J  P  Morgan Chase is proud of serving alongside Citigroup as bot  h lead lender and adviser to Enron on its acquisition by Dynegy  the dual r  ole it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank  Wit  h Enron s shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidde  n debts  J  P  Morgan Chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of   other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with Dynegy on track    20 Thanks largely to the slump on Wall Street  J  P  Morgan Chase s profits fe  ll by two thirds in the third quarter  to  449 million from  1 4 billion in   the period a year ago  Its stock has dropped 15 percent this year  more th  an other banks  shares  The bank s stock is ahead of investment banks like   Goldman Sachs  with which J  P  Morgan Chase increasingly competes  20   The jury is still out in many respects on this merger    said Judah Kraus  haar  an analyst at Merrill Lynch  Nevertheless  he likes J  P  Morgan Chas  e s stock  he said  because   expectations are very low    20 All J  P  Morgan Chase s competitors are suffering from the slowdown on Wal  l Street  But some  like Citigroup  are better diversified and have greater   involvement in old fashioned consumer banking  which is proving to be a st  rong moneymaker this year  20 Nearly a third of J  P  Morgan Chase s revenues are consumer oriented  By c  ontrast  its chief New York rival  Citigroup  gets half its revenues from c  onsumer businesses  20   The timing of the merger was bad    said Steven Wharton  a banking analys  t at Loomis  Sayles   Company  which owns about a million J  P  Morgan Chas  e shares    There s no disputing that    20 Actually  Mr  Harrison disputes it    I can t tell you how happy I am about   having done this merger    he said in a recent interview    While there ar  e pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment  we have a   much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time    20 In Mr  Harrison s favor is his battle tested team of top executives who hav  e worked together for a decade or more  Few executives remain in the top sp  ots from the old J  P  Morgan  Instead  most major posts are filled by mana  gers who have worked with Mr  Harrison since his days at Chemical Bank  whe  re he spent most of his career  Mr  Harrison s team successfully gobbled up   Manufacturers Hanover Bank in 1991  then followed that with Chemical s mer  ger with Chase Manhattan in 1996 before incorporating Morgan into the fold   last year  20 The group of Chemical veterans includes Marc J  Shapiro  who oversees finan  ce and risk management at J  P  Morgan Chase  Donald H  Layton  one of two   leaders of investment banking  and James B  Lee Jr   the bank s senior deal   maker  The team also includes Dina Dublon  the bank s chief financial offi  cer  20 Two other senior executives have also lived through big deals  Geoffrey T    Boisi  the other investment banking leader  was the one time investment ban  king chief at Goldman  Sachs  David A  Coulter  in charge of Chase s retail   bank  had been chief executive of Bank of America before it was bought by   NationsBank  20   There aren t many teams that have gone through as many mergers as Bill Ha  rrison and his team    said Mark G  Solow  managing principal at GarMark Ad  visors  an investment firm  and a former senior executive at Chemical  20 Still  Ms  Dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the J  P    Morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations  20   In general  mergers are very hard on morale    she said    There is no qu  estion that this one has a tougher emotional toll    20 The bank s executives are making the best of a bad situation  They have tak  en advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks    staff  or about 2 500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merg  er was announced  20 Many of these job cuts were aimed at high cost investment bankers  J  P  Mo  rgan Chase expects that 6 000 jobs in its investment banking division will   have been eliminated by the end of the year  20   We have focused on the tougher jobs to cut    Ms  Dublon said  20 In some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for J  P  Morgan   Chase to overhaul its staff  With fewer jobs available on Wall Street  Mr    Shapiro said  the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain a  bout changes in their jobs    People have fewer options    he said    so yo  u have a little more control over the process    20 Thanks partly to these cuts  the bank estimates the saving from cost cuttin  g will be  3 6 billion annually  compared with an original projection of  2   billion at the time of the merger  20 The cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits   in the bank s core businesses    What we can control and are managing very   aggressively is the expenses of the company    Ms  Dublon said in a confer  ence call with reporters on Oct  17  the day earnings were announced  20 Aside from cost cuts  the weakness on Wall Street makes it hard for the ban  k s executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking  where fees   were down 24 percent in the third quarter  But Mr  Harrison points to mark  et share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on Wall   Street  He hopes that when the investment banking business revives  J  P  M  organ Chase will hold on to these gains  20 The bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas  mergers and ac  quisitions  and the underwriting of large investment grade bond deals  20 The bank ranked 5th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising   on mergers during the first nine months of 2001  up from Chase s 12th plac  e finish and J  P  Morgan s 10th place standing during the same period last   year  according to Thomson Financial Securities data  20 The merger and acquisitions business  which Chase had been slowly building   for years  is stronger following the merger with J  P  Morgan  said Mr  Lee    a vice chairman at the bank  As a result  the bank is able to win assignm  ents providing advice to customers who dealt with the old Chase only for lo  ans  20 Mr  Lee remains proud of the bank s work with Enron  the energy company  de  spite its troubles  J  P  Morgan Chase  along with Citigroup  raised  1 bil  lion in bank financing for Enron earlier this month  It was also hired to a  dvise the company  which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken ove  r by Dynegy  20 The old Chase  long a lending powerhouse  would have had a good shot at lea  ding the bank financing  but an advisory role would have been less certain    Mr  Lee said the investment banker advising Enron came from the old J  P    Morgan  But with merger activity slow  there are few such deals to go aroun  d  20 The bank is also proud of its strength in long term investment grade bonds    another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger    It moved up to second place in that area so far this year  compared with s  ixth place a year ago  20 The bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings  a   surge driven by today s low interest rates  In May J  P  Morgan Chase rais  ed  12 billion in bonds for WorldCom  the telecommunications company  in th  e largest corporate debt deal in the United States on record  20 Unfortunately for J  P  Morgan Chase  the fees for underwriting investment   grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offe  rings of stock  where J  P  Morgan Chase remains a second tier competitor    20 The bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of sto  ck  falling to 9th place this year  compared with the old J  P  Morgan s 6t  h place finish a year ago   Chase was 11th   20 Mr  Harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock of  ferings to build momentum slowly in that business    We think we have a cha  nce in the second half of this year to be in the top five    he said  20 Given the slowdown  some bankers predict that Mr  Harrison will ultimately   do another deal  either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolst  er weak areas in investment banking  like the equity division  20   The general view is that the combination with J  P  Morgan didn t do enou  gh    one investment banker said  20 Mr  Harrison disagrees    I don t feel    he said    we need to do another   large deal to be successful     Photo  William B  Harrison Jr   the chief executive  says he has no doubts   about the wisdom of forming J  P  Morgan Chase  even though the the economy   has slowed since then    I can t tell you how happy I am about having done   this merger    he said   Associated Press  Chart    Still Looking for the   Right Mix   When J  P  Morgan and Chase announced their merger in September   2000  the combination s strength in investment banking seemed sure to be s  uccessful  But the

entirely  20 Houston based Dynegy and its advisers were expected to spend the long holid  ay weekend reviewing larger cross town rival Enron s complex books  as both   parties race against the decline

Enron was working on obtaining an additional  500 million   to  1 billion in private equity funding to help shore up the balance sheet    20 Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said due diligence was

Enron that Dynegy most covets   could cause low fourth quarte  r earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its p  rofitability  Continued losses there would remove a key attraction for Dyne  gy  20 Electricity traders said the latest developments are making it seem more li  kely that Dynegy will renegotiate the deal or back out entirely  a move the  y said would leave Enron vulnerable to creditors and a possible bankruptcy    20 This week rating agency Fitch Investors said that if Dynegy stepped away fr  om the merger  Enron s credit situation seemed untenable and

CASH CRUNCH 20 A downgrade to  junk  status could imperil Enron s trading business  force   it to pay off as much as  3 9 billion of debt issued mostly by two trusts    and possibly force it to seek bankruptcy protection  analysts said  20 Enron said in a securities filing it recently had less than  2 billion of a  vailable cash and credit lines  20 S P said on Tuesday that Enron faces  liquidity issues   but enjoys an  ali  gnment of interests  with its banks and a near term financial position that    is expected to be sufficient  to allow the Dynegy merger  20 Fitch  meanwhile  said on Wednesday that  our present  BBB minus  rating re  sts on the merger possibility and continued support of the lending banks     20 If Dynegy walks away  it said   Enron s credit situation seems

Traders  Perfect Storm Stalls By Christina Cheddar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  11 23 2001 Dow Jones News Service  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    NEW YORK   Dow Jones   Here s one 2001 outlook that couldn t have been more   wrong  20 Around this time last year  pundits and fund managers were touting  the per  fect storm  of market forces that were coming together to make the energy t  rading business one to watch in 2001  Then came the California power crisis  and allegations of price gouging and   fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group  That wa  s followed by renewed volatility in power prices  and this time the prices   were headed down  not up  20 And then came a crushing blow against trading firms   the unraveling of the   industry s largest player  Enron Corp   ENE   20 Simply put  the perfect storm stalled  and a business once buoyed by high g  as prices  strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters  20 The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth sto  cks than utilities are instead mired at around nine times earnings   about   where traditional utilities trade  20 And the chance for recovery in 2002  20 Basu Mullick  portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund  is w  illing to bet there is  He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same   price to earnings multiple as the broader market s median  which is current  ly between 16  to 17 times future earnings  he said  It s just a matter of   time before the stocks get there  20  They were just recovering from Gray Davis   Mullick said  referring to the   governor of California  who had accused  out of state  energy traders of a  rtificially inflating the price of power in the state  and triggering the s  tate s energy crisis   Now  they are recovering from Enron   20 The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices  warm weather and poor   demand for the recent weak performance in the group  20  Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates   he sai  d   I don t think they should get the same valuation as a garden variety ut  ility   20 Still  others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions bet  ween the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies  strategie  s and financial disclosures  20 Enron s precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accoun  ting issues  Although many of Enron s financial problems aren t solely the   fault of mark to market accounting issues  there has been growing attention   paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatilit  y it can create  20 Answers Elude Investors 20  Investors are asking hard questions  and not always getting the answers the  y want  20 Using mark to market methods  a company calculates the fair market value of   a commodity position   whether it s a contract  an option  a swap  etc      at the time  even if the value of the position is realized over a longer pe  riod  The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes fr  om the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its o  riginal assessment  Also  sometimes it isn t easy to calculate the fair val  ue of the commodity position  This is particularly true in instances where   the market for the commodity isn t liquid  20 Over time  companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their m  ark to market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterpa  rts that provide little or no disclosure  said ABN AMRO Inc  analyst Paul P  atterson  20 Encouragingly  it appears companies may already be responding to the call f  or added disclosure  According to a survey Patterson conducted  more compan  ies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their   mark to market accounting practices during third quarter conference calls   compared with those in the second quarter  20 Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash based  20  All things being equal  we believe reported earnings that more closely ref  lect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with t  hem than earnings that do not   he said  20 He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between ear  nings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark to market   accounting  20 At the end of the day  it is not a matter of simply producing profits  but   being able to say where those earnings came from  said one investor  who ma  nages a pension fund  20 Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the   energy merchants produce  20 Tim O Brien  portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund  said energy m  erchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positi  ons should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditi  onal utility companies  Still  the stocks should be valued at less than the   growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity p  rices  20 Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc   DYN   Duke Energy C  orp   DUK  and Dominion Resources Inc   D   20 According to O Brien  the group never deserved to have the price to earning  s multiples above 20  to 30 times earnings  which were once paid for the st  ocks  20  We all got sucked up by the up leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclic  al these companies are   O Brien said  adding that the average multiple sho  uld be in the high single digits to the high teens  20 As for independent power producers   which are companies without regulated   operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade   in the wholesale market   the group may wind up being valued on the basis o  f the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio  according to O Br  ien  20  One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real estate plays     O Brien said  20 That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp   CPN   which is already in the   lower half of its trading range  may have further to fall  20  By Christina Cheddar  Dow Jones Newswires  201 938

launch a major new electronic trading platform   known as eNymex  and may decide to scrap them  20 Management changes at the New York Mercantile Exchange  along with the succ  ess of Access  an online platform the exchange expanded in September  have   prompted the move  Nymex may decide to combine parts of eNymex with Access  according to sourc  es close to the matter  It is also exploring the idea of alliances with oth  er exchanges  and considering developing  e mini  contracts   smaller energ  y contracts for Internet based trade by retail investors  20  There s new management in place at the exchange   said Nymex spokeswoman N  achamah Jacobovits   They re rethinking all of our business strategies  and   one very massive strategy was the idea of this major eNymex B2B  business   to business  system launch with a whole new slate of products   20 Nymex and GlobalView Software Inc   a company that initially worked on buil  ding the eNymex trading system  have sued each other in a dispute over work   on the project  20 Kiodex  an electronic trading technology firm that has developed the back e  nd of the eNymex system  took on added development work for the project aft  er GlobalView departed  The trade engine Kiodex was asked to build is  subs  tantially complete  but the company can t speak to Nymex s overall electron  ic trading strategy   a Kiodex source said  20 The eNymex platform was conceived as a forum for trading over the counter e  nergy products  but Nymex has already moved ahead with plans for trading so  me of them on Access  initially an overnight trading system that was expand  ed in September  It hopes  for example  to launch gas swaps based on delive  ry at the Henry Hub within the next six weeks on Access  Jacobovits said    20  We ve expedited plans for a Henry Hub natural gas swap contract   Jacobovi  ts said   Traders could be looking for OTC clearing on a neutral based plat  form  which is a factor in that decision   20 Before Sept  14  Access was used only to trade energy futures at night  aft  er the day s Nymex session had ended  Use was limited to Nymex members with   dedicated phone systems  20 The exchange had been planning to expand use of Access  but ended up doing   so sooner than it had expected  On Sept  14  it started offering Access tra  ding over the Internet  a move that will eventually allow Nymex to open up   trade to more users  20 The move was intended to help keep futures markets liquid after the Sept  1  1 attack on the World Trade Center  Nymex s building  located near where th  e trade towers stood  was shut down for several days after the attacks  Exp  anding its already existent Access system to the Internet helped ease poten  tial liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading   hours after Nymex reopened  20 Development of the eNymex system began last year under the direction of for  mer Nymex Chairman Daniel Rappaport  In August  Nymex said it would launch   the eNymex platform within four to eight months  New Nymex President J  Rob  ert  Bo  Collins Jr  said then that vendor problems had slowed development   of the system s front end technology and caused the delays  But he still ex  pected eNymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original prod  uct line  20 If Nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as eNyme  x with Access  the new system may end up being known as eNymex  20  eNymex right now is looking for a new mission   said an industry source cl  ose to Nymex   You know how politics works  We don t scrap it  we just rena  me it  Anything we do electronically is now going to be called eNymex  But   the original deal and concept that Rappaport initiated is done   20 Nymex s reconsideration comes as the energy trading world undergoes rapid c  hange  The two most successful online energy trading platforms    Enron Cor  p  s  ENE  EnronOnline  and IntercontinentalExchange  or ICE    have seen t  heir luck turn   in opposite directions  20 Enron Corp   ENE   which accounts for about 25  of the trade in U S  power   and gas markets  faces questions about its creditworthiness as the Securiti  es and Exchange Commission investigates complicated financial dealings  Enr  on s possible merger with Dynegy Inc   DYN   now appears to be in doubt  an  d energy trading companies are pulling back their exposure to the company    20 Enron executes about 60  of its power and gas trades on EnronOnline  When E  nron s troubles surfaced last month  Nymex quickly moved to extend its clea  ring services to over the counter natural gas derivatives  a move the tradi  ng community saw as an attempt to grab market share  20 ICE  on the other hand  is moving ahead with plans to capture more energy t  rade on its electronic format  ICE closed a deal this summer to acquire the   London based International Petroleum Exchange   Nymex s chief competitor a  nd Europe s largest traditional energy exchange  It plans to move all IPE e  nergy contracts to its Internet based system and offer clearing services fo  r some over the counter contracts  20 Nymex is exploring alliances that could give it a better footing in the new   competitive landscape  One idea under review is a joint venture with the C  hicago Mercantile Exchange to offer e mini contracts for Nymex products on   CME s Globex electronic trading system  the person close to Nymex said  20 Nymex officials wouldn t confirm whether they re talking with the CME  but   they said the relationship between the exchanges is a warm one  20  Nymex is always open to strategic alliances   Jacobovits said   There s no  thing we ve agreed to at this point  but we have open dialogue with a numbe  r of exchanges concerning strategic alliances  We have a good relationship   with the Chicago Merc  and we certainly would be open to working with them     20 Shortly after the Sept  11 terrorist attacks in New York shut down the Nyme  x trading floor  the CME said it would be willing to offer Nymex products o  n its Globex system until Nymex resumed operations  Jacobovits said  20  By Stephen Parker  Dow Jones

seen weathering major layoffs  By Ellen Chang  11 23 2001 Reuters English News Service  C  Reuters Limited 2001   HOUSTON  Nov 23  Reuters    Houston s economy  buffered by a broad and dive  rse tax base  should be able to weather thousands of layoffs from some of t  he city s major corporations  including energy powerhouse Enron Corp   econ  omists and analysts said  20 Financially ailing Enron Corp    which has 21 000 employees worldwide and i  s in talks to be bought by Houston based rival Dynegy Inc    is the third m  ajor employer in the city to announce severe financial problems in recent m  onths  Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs  Continental announced a layoff of 3 000 employees after the Sept  11 attack  s and Hewlett Packard Co  s plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp  will  if fina  lized  result in 15 000 layoffs at the two companies  Compaq also announced   8 000 layoffs worldwide in July  20  It s fair to say that the potential layoffs at Enron and the layoffs at Co  ntinental  taken alone  are negative factors  although probably small in th  e grand scope of the Houston economy   said Phil Scheps  director of Housto  n s finance and administration department  20 Since last month when Enron became a target of a Securities and Exchange Co  mmission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships  the energ  y giant s market share has steadily eroded  20 While neither Enron nor Dynegy have given any indication of the number of l  ayoffs that could hit Houston  Barton Smith  director of the Institute for   Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston  said the layoffs  will b  e spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive   20 Robin Kapiloff  an analyst at Moody s Investors Service  said the city s ef  forts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenu  e collections  even as some of the city s biggest employers suffer   We re   watching to see where things go now   she said  20 Alex Fraser  a director at Standard   Poor s  said the ratings agency isn t   concerned about Houston s credit position at this point   While Enron is c  ertainly a large player and prominent corporation  we re unclear on what th  e impact would be   20 While the fourth largest city in the country experienced a bit of a slowdow  n since the Sept  11 attacks  Houston has outperformed the rest of the nati  on  20 With a tax base of  87 3 billion in 2001  Houston is also buffered by the T  exas Medical Center  the city s largest employer  Next year the city s tax   base is estimated to grow to  95 billion  20 Still  the national recession  energy price weakness in general  and the in  itial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the cit  y to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1 5 percent from 5 percent    That revised estimate equals a  13 million reduction in the city s  1 4 bi  llion budget  20 But the city s property tax revenue has not been affected  Only a small cha  nge in property tax collections is expected in 2002 because valuations are   based on Jan  1 data and for most of 2001  real estate growth was very larg  e  Scheps said  20 While recent economic indicators appear positive  and consumer confidence h  as quickly rebounded  a better read on the strength of Houston s tax revenu  e collections will be available in February when the city receives data for   the December holiday season  Scheps said   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved   09  Dabhol Pwr Confirms Arbitrator Panel Mtg In

Jones Business News  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp   Dynegy Inc  is   coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult  ibillion dollar deal  Friday s Wall Street Journal reported  20 The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron  E  NE  shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy tradin  g company  the nation s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas  Du  ring the past month  Enron has taken a  1 billion write off of assets  revi  sed downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a  1 2 billio  n reduction in shareholder equity  The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn  erships  run by some of its own executives  under investigation by the Secu  rities and Exchange Commission  In an SEC filing Monday  Enron disclosed hu  ndreds of millions of potential additional write offs as well as the possib  ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t  han  2 billion in loans by the end of the year  20 As of 4 p m  Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading  Enron   shares fell  1 98  or 28   to  5 01 each after having dropped 23  Tuesday    In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday  more than four times the   volume of any other Big Board stock  Enron s bonds also again traded sharpl  y lower  market observers said  20 The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy s stock  which also was among the most a  ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange  As of 4 p m  Wednesday  Dyne  gy  DYN  shares fell  1 94 to  39 76 each  20 On Wednesday  Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi  ve Chuck Watson said his company was working  to accelerate the regulatory   approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously   announced agreement  though it continued to perform  due diligence  on Enr  on  20 Under the merger agreement  Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk   away from the deal if Enron s financial and legal problems become severe e  nough  However  some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so   called material adverse change clauses  They point to a decision earlier th  is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc  to c  omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc  even though Tyson  a Springdale  Ark     food products company  had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a   drop in IBP s earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit  20 Dynegy officials didn t return calls seeking comment  To complete the deal    two thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou  ld have to give their approval  No dates for those votes have been set  20 One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr  on contained information Dynegy hadn t known about  Dynegy representatives   planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i  nformation as part of the company s due diligence  this person said  It cou  ldn t be determined what the new information was  20 The merger agreement  announced Nov  9  calls for Dynegy to exchange 0 2685   share for each of Enron s roughly 850 million fully diluted shares  giving   the purchase a value of about  9 billion at Dynegy s current stock price    However  from a price standpoint  the deal is appearing less attractive to   Dynegy  20 On the day of the merger announcement  Enron shares were trading at about    8 63 each  or about 83  of the purchase price under the exchange ratio  As   of Wednesday  Enron s market price was only about 47  of the merger formula   price  Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme  nt  when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra  ding relatively close to the offering price  20 Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger  In  itially  many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron   and provide a major boost to Houston based Dynegy  Dynegy and Enron officia  ls have predicted that the merger  supposed to be completed late next year    would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy s earnings  20 Now analysts are challenging that assumption  Ron Barone  managing director   at UBS Warburg LLC  said he believes that because of Enron s financial pro  blems  a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than   Dynegy would have by itself  Mr  Barone said he thinks a  likely scenario    is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0 15   Dynegy share for each Enron share  20

an accounting controvers  y that prompted the firm to restate its earnings since 1997  eliminating mo  re than  580 million of reported income  20 Steve Berman  managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle    said Enron touted the value of its shares and encouraged employees to put   their entire portfolio into Enron stock  20 Enron officials didn t emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation   as positive  especially when the company s stock began to slide  said Berm  an  who is hoping to get the suit certified as a class action  20 Berman wants to prove that the company s 401 k  plan executives failed to a  ct responsibly when they knew about serious business problems  He s also ho  ping to break new legal ground with his case  20 The lawsuit is patterned after a case against Lucent Technologies in which   Lucent employees sued their employer this summer for matching their 401 k    contributions with company stock that tanked  That case is still in

Portland General s debt ratings due to    uncertainty at its parent Enron   Wednesday  the same agency said a bankrup  tcy filing by Enron was  highly possible  if the proposed rescue by Dynegy   collapses  20  We haven t seen any credit problems so far  and Portland General isn t in   the market  buying power for its customers  right now in a big way   Hemmin  gway said  20 However  he noted that   If they really were unable to conduct their busine  ss because they were not creditworthy we would have to use whatever instrum  ents are available  to make sure service to customers is maintained  Earlie  r this year  California was forced to take over buying power for the PG E u  nit of Pacific Gas   Electric and Edison International subsidiary Southern   California Edison after

private equity firm with  24 billion in assets  declined comment on Enron through spokeswoman Molly Morse of Kekst   Co        The New York based firm invested more than  1 3 billion in DPL Inc   a utility in Dayton  Ohio  and will receive  550 million of that back from the company after DPL sold  700 million of bonds in August          KKR very much gets involved in deals where there s a corporate partner and they don t have a majority stake    Snow said    They would possibly hold it for years  because they like slow exits    KKR is also a possible candidate because it recently raised a new  5 billion buyout fund        Any LBO firm would need assurance about how it will get its money back on an Enron investment  said Snow          The thing they have to be cautious about is the exit    he said    If there s a chance Dynegy would agree to buy out  the LBO firms   stake over time  that would give some confidence  But if the only exit is the public market  that s a little bit dicier          Any private investment also must be large enough to make a meaningful difference  Enron s market value is  3 7 billion and Dynegy has proposed paying  23 billion in stock and assumption of debt  That means the private equity portion would have to approach  1 billion or more        The 20 largest private equity firms have assets of more than  5 billion under management each  according to Asset Alternatives  a Wellesley  Massachusetts industry research firm  Still  many of those firms don t have enough free capital to undertake an investment of  500 million or more        An announcement of an investment may come soon  analysts say  Energy trading firms such as Mirant Corp  and Aquila Inc  are doing fewer trades with Enron because of concern that the company won t be able to finance its business  Enron shares have fallen by almost half in the past three sessions          They re going to need this investment within 30 to 45 days    said Sean Egan of Egan Jones Ratings Co    They re spiraling downward and they re going to need some more beyond the  1 5 billion contributed by   ChevronTexaco Corp   which owns 26 percent of Dynegy                               Other LBOs       Here s a rundown of the other most likely private equity partners for Enron          The Carlyle Group could invest through a  1 billion energy fund it s raising  as well as its general U S  buyout fund  said Snow  Carlyle s vice president for corporate communications  Chris Ullman  declined to comment          Blackstone  which has a history of investing alongside other corporate partners  recently closed on a  4 billion buyout fund  Blackstone spokesman John Ford declined to comment on whether Enron had approached the firm          Hicks  Muse  Tate   Furst  which is based in Texas like Dynegy and Enron  Hicks Muse counts Triton Energy Ltd   an energy exploration company  among its best investments  The firm recently raised about  1 5 billion for new investments  about one third of what it had hoped to raise  and has said it will focus on   back  to basics   investments in food  manufacturing and media  Mark Semer  a spokesman for Hicks Muse who also works for Kekst  declined comment on Enron        Spokesmen for two other firms  Warburg Pincus   Co  and Credit Suisse First Boston s private equity arm  didn t return calls seeking comment     Randy Whitestone in the New York newsroom  212  940 1805 20  Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit 2001 11 23 11 59  New York   Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit       Redmond  Washington Nov  23  Bloomberg     Microsoft Corp  s plans to expand its MSN high speed Internet service have been delayed by a lawsuit from Enron Corp   which could cost the company customers during the holiday season  analysts said        MSN had planned to have fast Internet access over telephone lines available  with help from energy trader Enron  in 45 markets starting Oct  25  Instead  the service is now on sale in about 30 markets  said MSN Product Manager Lisa Gurry        The latest delay follows a string of apparent bad luck that has delayed the rollout of Microsoft s fast Internet access service over the last year  The holidays are typically a popular time for customers to buy so called broadband access  often along with new personal computers purchased or received as gifts          They have a track record of picking broadband partners that don t quite work out    said Joe Laszlo  senior analyst at market researcher Jupiter Media Metrix Inc    It definitely hurts them with customers who want broadband right now          Subscribers to fast Internet access services are expected to grow fourfold by 2006  according to estimates by Jupiter Media Metrix  while sales of slower Internet access plans decline  Fast Internet service over phone lines uses digital subscriber line  or DSL  technology                            On Track       Gurry said Redmond  Washington based Microsoft is still on track to have fast access for sale by the end of March to 90 percent of the 45 million to 50 million households that have DSL available in their neighborhoods          There is very little growth left in the dial up access space for Microsoft or anybody  which leaves them with broadband as the only potential growth area for the MSN access business    said Youssef Squali  an analyst at FAC Equities  who rates Microsoft Internet competitor AOL Time Warner Inc  a   buy          Microsoft also wants to deliver consumer services like music and video and software updates  which require fast Internet access for smooth downloads        The company originally began a service with NorthPoint Communications Group Inc   a now bankrupt provider of fast Web access  Microsoft has also had difficulty finding partners among cable companies who use their networks for high speed service        Now Houston based Enron  which agreed in June to provide the backbone for a nationwide expansion of MSN s service  is suing  Enron claimed in its lawsuit that it isn t required to deliver broadband services if Microsoft hasn t first provided a billing and ordering system that the biggest software company agreed to build        Enron  which is being acquired by rival Dynegy Inc   recently disclosed debts of  9 15 billion due by 2003 and restated earnings for four years                           Slower Expansion       MSN has been selling high speed access in 14 states under partnership with Qwest Communications International Inc  for the last few months  MSN has begun the planned service expansion outside of those states by working with Enron competitors that MSN Marketing Director Bob Visse declined to name  The company is also talking to Enron  he said  Enron didn t return calls for comment        Because of the Enron suit the expansion is moving slower than expected  Visse said  Since Oct  25  MSN has added service in Los Angeles  San Francisco  San Diego and Sacramento  California  and Houston  Dallas  San Antonio and Austin  Texas  giving Microsoft a total of about 30 markets rather than 45  Plans to expand marketing are also on hold  Visse said          It is very unfortunate that we are in the position we are in    said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer        Top U S  Internet service provider America Online  owned by AOL Time Warner Inc   has also been slow to get into the high  speed market  analysts said        That doesn t mean Microsoft is in the clear  Laszlo said both MSN and AOL might pay for their sluggishness with tougher competition from third place EarthLink Inc  and from cable and telephone companies that have more experience selling high speed Internet access        America Online has more than 31 million subscribers to MSN s 7 million  EarthLink Inc  has 4 77 million subscribers  Laszlo doesn t think MSN or America Online can build the kind of lead in the high speed market that America Online has in the slower dial  up access market                           Not a Permanent Blow        Not that anyone need worry about Microsoft  MSN will be able to expand its fast Internet access business even with the delays  Laszlo said          They are already late in the broadband market so this means they get a little later    he said    But broadband will continue to grow over the next few years and this is definitely not a permanent blow          Analysts also say Microsoft still needs to find a cable partner that will let MSN use its network to sell fast access over cable lines  Cable is more popular than DSL with customers looking for fast Web service  The five largest cable providers control 51 percent of the U S  high speed Internet market  The five largest sellers of access via phone lines and DSL technology account for about 33 percent  according to market researcher ARS Inc        Microsoft MSN Vice President Yusuf Mehdi said last month the company may be interested in an investment in AT T Corp  s cable  television unit  which AT T is considering selling  Ballmer declined to comment on Microsoft s plans     Dina Bass in

Millions in Profit By Rebecca Smith and John R  Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal  10 19 2001 The Wall Street Journal C1  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    A limited partnership organized by Enron Corp  s chief financial officer  A  ndrew S  Fastow  realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it   did with Enron  according to an internal partnership document  20 The partnership  in some instances  benefited from renegotiating the terms   of existing deals with the Houston energy company in ways that improved the   partnership s financial positions or reduced its risk of losses  Mr  Fastow  and possibly a handful of partnership associates  realized more   than  7 million last year in management fees and about  4 million in capit  al increases on an investment of nearly  3 million in the partnership  whic  h was set up in December 1999 principally to do business with Enron  20 The profits from the deals were disclosed in a financial report to investor  s in the partnership  LJM2 Co Investment LP  that was signed by Mr  Fastow   as the general partner and dated April 30  In one case  the report indicate  s the partnership was able to improve profits by terminating a transaction   early  20 The LJM2 arrangement has become controversial for Enron  as shareholders an  d analysts have raised questions about whether it posed a conflict by putti  ng the company s chief financial officer  who has a fiduciary duty to Enron   shareholders  in a position of reaping financial rewards for representing   LJM2 investors in business deals with Enron  Investors in LJM2 include Wach  ovia Corp   General Electric Co  s General Electric Capital Corp  and Credi  t Suisse Group s Credit Suisse First Boston  20 Attention has focused on Mr  Fastow s partnership activities at a tumultuou  s time for Enron  which over the past decade grew enormously by becoming th  e nation s biggest energy trading company  20 This year  though  it has been hit by a string of troubles  from soured bus  iness initiatives to executive departures  On Tuesday  Enron announced a  6  18 million third quarter loss  because of a  1 01 billion write off on inve  stments in broadband telecommunications  retail energy services and Azurix   Corp   a water company  A small chunk of that write off  about  35 million    was attributed to ending certain LJM2 related transactions  That terminati  on also produced a  1 2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity as th  e company decided to repurchase 55 million shares that had been part of LJM  2 deals  20 At 4 p m  in New York Stock Exchange composite trading  Enron was down 9 9     or  3 20  to  29 a share  Within the past year  the stock had topped  80   a share  20 Enron officials didn t have any comment about the LJM2 partnership document    Enron has consistently said its dealings with LJM2 have been proper  They   said the LJM2 deals  like ones done with other parties  were aimed at help  ing hedge against fluctuating market values of its assets and adding source  s of capital  20 Mr  Fastow has declined several requests for an interview about LJM2  In la  te July  he formally severed his ties with LJM2  as a result of what Enron   officials said was growing unease by Wall Street analysts and major shareho  lders  Mr  Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been w  ith the firm 11 years  which included extensive work setting up and managin  g company investments  20 Michael Kopper  a former Enron executive who an Enron spokesman said is now   helping to operate LJM2  declined to comment  He also wouldn t describe hi  s relation to LJM2  20 In his April 30 report  Mr  Fastow said the partnership  which raised  394   million  had invested in several Enron related deals involving power plants   and other assets as well as company stock  The document said LJM2 sought a   29  internal rate of return  That was down from a 48  targeted rate of ret  urn at the end of 2000  which the document said was due in part to a declin  e in the value of LJM2 s investment in New Power Co   an Enron related ener  gy retailer  In some transactions  LJM2 did much better than the 29  target    though this sometimes involved renegotiating individual deals  20 In September 2000  the partnership invested  30 million in  Raptor III   wh  ich involved writing put options committing LJM2 to buy Enron stock at a se  t price for six months  Four months into this deal  LJM2 approached Enron t  o settle the investment early   causing LJM2 to receive its  30 million cap  ital invested plus  10 5 million in profit   the report said  The renegotia  tion was before a decline in Enron s stock price  which could have forced L

 mailto kcswanson thestreet com  Staff Reporter TheStreet com 10 19 2001 06 59 AM EDT URL   http   www thestreet com markets dumbest 10002661 html   1  Bayer Fighting the Bears  One beneficiary of the anthrax scare has been Bayer AG  BAYZY OTC BB ADR     news   commentary    the German chemical maker  which has seen its share pr  ice gain 10 4  since the terrorist attacks  But investors bidding up the st  ock might be getting ahead of themselves  20 Bayer makes Cipro  a leading treatment for anthrax  But while the demand fo  r Cipro is high  sales from the drug are only a small portion of the compan  y s overall revenue  which totaled 30 9 billion euros last year  and  accor  ding to analysts  will increase even more this year  due to its acquisition   of Aventis CropScience  a crop protection and production company   To put   the demand for Cipro in context  J P  Morgan expects U S  sales of the drug   to be approximately 1 2 billion euros for 2001  20 Even emergency purchases of Cipro probably won t add that much to Bayer s o  verall revenues  The president has asked for  643 million for antibiotics t  o combat bioterrorist attacks  While it s possible that sum will be increas  ed  not all the money would be spent on Cipro  20 Besides  it s not even clear that Bayer will remain the only producer of Ci  pro  Though the company holds the patent for the drug  there s some pressur  e in Congress for the government to purchase a generic version from other m  anufacturers  20 On another front  Bayer is currently battling a class action lawsuit relate  d to an anti cholesterol drug implicated in a number of deaths  It was forc  ed to withdraw the drug from the market  20 Bayer may offer protection against anthrax  but that doesn t mean it s a re  fuge for investors  20 2  Losses at Twice the Price You know things are bad for a company when its losses per share are double   the price of the shares themselves  That s the case for i2 Technologies  IT  WO Nasdaq   news   commentary    the supply chain software maker  After mar  ket close on Tuesday  the company posted losses under generally accepted ac  counting principles that amounted to  5 5 billion  or  13 25 per share  for   the latest quarter  including all charges  20 In other words  i2 s losses were more than twice the value of its share pri  ce  which closed at  5 69 before the announcement  20 Much of the huge writedown reflects amortized goodwill from the purchase of   Aspect Development in March 2000  20 To be fair  investors in companies that have made big acquisitions like i2   typically focus on pro forma earnings  which exclude charges and extraordin  ary items  By that measure  i2 s losses didn t look quite so bad  The compa  ny met analysts  consensus expectations with a loss of  55 3 million  or 13   cents per share  20 Still  investors met i2 s earnings with disapproval  knocking the stock dow  n 25  the day after they were reported  20 3  Microsoft s Bag of Tricks In times like these  there s comfort in knowing business goes on as usual a  t many U S  companies  Just like the old days  Microsoft  MSFT Nasdaq   new  s   commentary  is in the hot seat for its sharklike behavior toward a comp  etitor  20 It stands accused of sending 3 000 fake cereal boxes emblazoned with the wo  rds  Microsoft Server Crunch  to customers of rival server software maker N  ovell  The boxes  according to Novell  contained  a number of false and mis  leading statements  intended as putdowns of Novell products  20 Among the attempted insults were some not so clever plays on packaged food    For example  in a reference to Novell s flagship software product  a line   on the Microsoft boxes read   What s the expiration date on that NetWare pl  atform    A round of applause  please  for those gut splittingly funny engi  neers   20 The boxes also said Novell is shifting its focus from software to consultin  g services  which Novell says isn t true  20 Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the cereal boxes were primarily intende  d to advertise Microsoft services  not to slight Novell   It was all in the   theme of a mock cereal box   he said   It was a modest campaign   20 In response to Novell s complaints  he says Microsoft sent out a letter in   September to recipients of the boxes to clarify some of its statements  and   it s just agreed to send another letter to appease the company  For the re  cord  Novell said it s not calling off its lawsuit for unspecified money da  mages  20 4  AMD s Feisty Pledge CEOs don t get their jobs by being eloquent  and it probably would be too m  uch to expect them to sound statesmanlike  But sometimes their oratorical r  ough edges cross the line into embarrassing  20 Case in point  Comments from Jerry Sanders  the CEO of Advanced Micro Devic  es  AMD NYSE   news   commentary    which earlier this week reported a loss   for the first time in almost three years  The company  facing harsh pricin  g competition from Intel  INTC Nasdaq   news   commentary    said its reven  ue was down 22  from a year ago and it expects a likely operating loss for   the fourth quarter  20 Given recent declines in consumer confidence  the downturn is likely to be   extended by several quarters  Sanders admitted  But in a conference call  h  e indulged in some spirited fist shaking  Citing the company s so called  H  ammer  architecture for processors  Sanders declared   We feel that when th  e upturn comes  we re going to kick       20 Does this guy carry around a surfboard in his car or what  Mr  Sanders  mee  t Mr  Reeves  20 OK  so we actually kind of admire Sanders  never capitulate spirit  But his   comment seems a little redundant  because just about everybody will look b  etter when the economy turns around  Because that may not be anytime soon    what matters is how companies weather the interim    feisty pledges notwith  standing  20 5  Enron s Rabbit From a Hat Style Analysts have complained for some time about Enron s  ENE NYSE   news   com  mentary  rabbit from a hat style accounting  with which the company produce  d results that wowed investors without making it quite clear where they cam  e from  Now that its business has taken a sour turn  that tendency has gott  en even more unsettling  20 To cap off its disappointing earnings results this week    Enron posted a s  teep loss after taking a  1 01 billion charge    the company let drop that   its shareholder equity had decreased by  1 2 billion  20 In a conference call  CEO Kenneth Lay attributed the reduction in equity to   the  removal of an obligation to issue a number of shares   According to a   report in The Wall Street Journal  Enron repurchased 55 million shares iss  ued through a series of transactions involving LJM Capital  a partnership t  hat until recently was headed up by Enron s CFO  20 TSC s Peter Eavis has written that it appears Enron lent LJM money to buy E  nron stock  20 Ironically  the company boasted in its earnings release this week that it h  ad expanded reporting of its financial results  presumably to quiet its acc  ounting critics  20 Enron s transactions have been so labyrinthine that it s hard to identify e  xactly if or how they were inappropriate  But the latest revelation  to say   the least  does nothing to bolster the company s credibility  Enron  whose   CEO resigned unexpectedly in August  had seen its stock fall 59  for the y  ear leading up to its latest earnings release  Since then  it s dropped ano  ther 12 6  20   The New Power Company

The Shifting Lineup Shawn Zeller  10 20 2001 National Journal Copyright 2001 by National Journal Group Inc  All rights reserved   How do the Washington lobbying firms with the heftiest incomes put themselv  es in the upper echelon of K Street practitioners  Van Scoyoc Associates In  c  does it by signing up a stable of smaller clients and working hard to re  tain them  Quinn Gillespie   Associates doesn t have a long client list  bu  t it is at the top of the heap in terms of average fee per client  Greenber  g Traurig  meanwhile  lured away a rival firm s top rainmaker and his lucra  tive book of clients  20 These are just some of the business strategies revealed in National Journal   s survey of the 10 Washington lobbying firms with the highest fee income f  rom January 1 to June 30  The four top firms at midyear 2001 are the same o  nes as a year earlier  perennial powerhouses Cassidy   Associates Inc   Pat  ton Boggs  Akin  Gump  Strauss  Hauer   Feld  and Verner  Liipfert  Bernhar  d  McPherson and Hand  But two new players boasting huge growth rates are among the firms nipping   at the heels of these top dogs  20 Greenberg Traurig  which came in at No  5 in National Journal s midyear 200  1 rankings  had never before been in the top tier of Washington lobbying fi  rms  According to PoliticalMoneyLine  which compiles a comprehensive annual   list of all lobbying firms  Greenberg Traurig had the 35th highest income   during the first six months of last year  20 And No  7 in the midyear 2001 rankings is Quinn Gillespie  another first ti  me member of the top 10  Formed just a year and a half ago by former Clinto  n White House Counsel Jack Quinn and Ed Gillespie a one time adviser to Hou  se Majority Leader Dick Armey  R Texas the firm has seen its fortunes rocke  t upward  Quinn Gillespie was No  13 in the first six months of 2000  20 In between these two newcomers is Van Scoyoc Associates  ranked at No  6  T  here has been a steady rise for Van Scoyoc  which was No  28 in fee income   at the end of 1996  the year in which the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act firs  t took effect  20 Rounding out the top 10 at midyear 2001 are stalwarts Williams   Jensen  Wa  shington Council Ernst   Young  and Barbour Griffith   Rogers  20 National Journal ranks the top 10 lobbying firms every six months by tallyi  ng the fees that firms report to the House and Senate as required under the   1995 legislation  National Journal tabulates total fees for only the 25 to  p firms in PoliticalMoneyLine s comprehensive annual survey  20 With its  16 68 million in fees for the first six months of the year  Cassi  dy   Associates continued to blow away the competition  The last time any f  irm reported a six month total larger than Cassidy s was during the first h  alf of 1998  when Verner  Liipfert led the way  During the first six months   of this year  Cassidy   Associates received a massive fee of  1 million fr  om the Taiwan Studies Institute  a think tank with close ties to the Taiwan  ese government  Boeing Co  paid Cassidy   Associates  600 000  and Tiffany     Co  paid it  400 000 to lobby on legislation that would bar diamonds mine  d in conflict ridden areas of the world from entering the global market  20 Despite the economic downturn and the terrorist threat  lobbying goes on  c  ompany Chairman Gerald S J  Cassidy said   During difficult times  people c  ome to Washington with their problems  During more robust times  they come   seeking opportunities   20 But the biggest story at midyear was the rise of Greenberg Traurig  The fir  m  which posted just  1 71 million in lobbying fees during the first half o  f 2000  saw that amount more than quadruple to nearly  8 7 million this yea  r  Much of the credit goes to Jack Abramoff  the conservative K Street move  r and shaker who is an ally of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay  R Texas  Last   year  Abramoff left his old firm  Preston Gates Ellis   Rouvelas Meeds  an  d brought  3 million in business with him to Greenberg Traurig  Preston Gat  es  which was ranked in the top five during Abramoff s tenure  dropped out   of National Journal s rankings this year  The lobbying firm s fees fell by   nearly 50 percent  20 Abramoff continued to make rain at Greenberg Traurig  billing  860 000 to t  he Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians   500 000 to the Commonwealth of the   Northern Mariana Islands  and  300 000 to garment manufacturers that opera  te in that U S  territory  A few new clients also forked over big bucks  th  e Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana   440 000   Voor Huisen Project Management    a homebuilder with international operations   300 000   and the American In  ternational Center   100 000   Despite initial concerns among some Greenber  g Traurig partners about whether Abramoff would fit in  Abramoff insists th  at his team of lobbyists has been  totally integrated  into the firm  20 But Abramoff wasn t the only one responsible for Greenberg Traurig s higher   earnings  Ronald W  Kleinman  a former State Department lawyer  persuaded   Congress with the help of several Greenberg Traurig colleagues to pass Sect  ion 2002 of the 2000 Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act  Th  is section of the law ordered the Treasury Secretary to use Cuban governmen  t funds that are frozen in U S  banks to compensate the families of three m  en who had won multimillion dollar judgments against Cuba under a 1996 amen  dment to the Foreign Sovereignty Immunities Act  The amendment allows victi  ms of terrorism or their families to sue states that are on the U S  list o  f state sponsors of terrorism  20 Greenberg Traurig represented the families of Armando Alejandre  Carlos Alb  erto Costa  and Mario M  de la Pena three members of Brothers to the Rescue    a Cuban American group that rescues Cubans in the waters off Florida  The   three men died when their plane was shot down over international waters on   February 24  1996  The families sued Cuba and were awarded  96 7 million i  n damages by a U S  District Court judge in 1997  The State Department oppo  sed payment  but President Clinton signed the trafficking bill  Greenberg T  raurig reported a fee of  4 million  20 Fred W  Baggett  the chair of Greenberg Traurig s governmental practice gro  up  said this was a one time fee  but he added that the Cuban case  establi  shed a platform so that the firm can support undertaking those one time eff  orts in the future   and noted   We have a few coming down the pipeline     20 Baggett said the firm has cases involving an American killed in Jerusalem b  y the Palestinian group Hamas  and Americans who were used as human shields   in Iraq during the Persian Gulf War  None of the Americans was killed  and   all were eventually released  20 Taking the flip side of the mega fee approach was Van Scoyoc Associates  wh  ich reported receiving no fee above  180 000  Nonetheless  the firm continu  ed its steady rise  A key reason  said firm President H  Stewart Van Scoyoc    was the ability to recruit and retain clients  The firm signed up 34 clie  nts between January 1 and June 30  while only nine out of 159 clients termi  nated contracts during the period  20  We work hard at defining the relationship with a client before we sign a c  ontract   said Van Scoyoc   We make sure we re clear on the goals and objec  tives  and in a typical relationship  we don t guarantee that we can do eve  rything   The firm s  6 24 million total for the first half of 2001 was 23   percent higher than its fees for the same period last year  20 Quinn Gillespie s ascent into the top 10 was more along the lines of Greenb  erg Traurig s  Quinn Gillespie s billings were almost  6 09 million at midy  ear 2001  a 71 percent rise over the same period last year  The firm has on  ly 34 paying clients  but the average fee per client  180 000 is the highes  t among the top 10  During the six months  the British Columbia Lumber Trad  e Council paid a fee of  540 000 to Quinn Gillespie  while Enron Corp  paid    525 000  The Canadian group hoped its high powered lobbyists would win gr  eater access for Canadian lumber in the United States  but U S  tariffs wer  e reinstated earlier this year  Lobbying for Enron focused on energy deregu  lation  particularly in California  Enron is a major creditor of Southern C  alifornia Edison  the utility whose financial woes resulted in power shorta  ges in California last summer  20 Quinn Gillespie s staff has grown from nine at the time of the founding to   nearly 30 today   We like to think we have a toolbox here people who may be   Republicans or Democrats but who also have different skills that benefit t  he client   Quinn said  20 Patton Boggs had fees of  10 26 million in the first six months of 2001  bu  t that was just a 5 percent rise over the same period in 2000  Still  the f  irm leapfrogged over Verner  Liipfert to capture the No  2 ranking  Patton   Boggs earned  360 000 from Russia s government owned NTV television network    which was at the center of a controversy earlier this year when the gover  nment took over the independent network and ousted its staff  20 Akin  Gump also jumped past Verner  Liipfert to No  3 in the rankings  post  ing  9 48 million in fees a 16 percent increase over a year earlier  Akin    Gump s biggest client was the troubled tire manufacturer Bridgestone Firest  one Inc   which paid just over  1 5 million in fees  Akin  Gump also earned   big money from AT T   800 000  and the Gila River Indian Community   620 0  00   20 At No  4  Verner  Liipfert saw the biggest drop in fees  taking in  8 84 mi  llion in the first six months of 2001 down 16 percent from the same period   in 2000  Verner  Liipfert lost lucrative contracts with Puerto Rico after t  he government there changed hands last year   See this issue  p  3273   20 Rounding

induction event    20 As chairman of Weingarten Realty Investors  Stanford Alexander built the co  mpany into one of the nation s largest publicly traded real estate companie  s  20 After serving in the U S  Air Force  Alexander joined J  Weingarten  a Hous  ton based chain of 87 supermarkets  He later became an executive with Weing  arten Markets Realty Co   an affiliated real estate firm that

 Jim H  arris and industrial designer Ted Papajohn  Canion envisioned a portable co  mputer that ran all the programs that operated on the IBM PC  20 By the next year  the company was producing the original Compaq luggable co  mputer  a move that essentially created the modern PC industry  By 1987  it  s fifth year  the company made business history by breaking  1 billion in s  ales  the fastest pace ever for a corporate startup  20 Canion left Compaq in October 1991 but continued to be active in other vent  ures  In 1992  he founded Insource Technology Group  a consulting services   and network engineering firm  and continues to serve as chairman  20 Don Jordan has been in the forefront of Houston business and society for de  cades  And even though he retired from the post of

public funds for the new downtown arena  Watson had opposed an ear  lier deal to use public money to build the facility  20 Watson has also been a strong supporter of Houston s bid to land the 2012 O

Travel Fears To Subdue LME Week By Mark Long Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  10 19 2001 Dow Jones Commodities Service  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    LONDON   Dow Jones   The many travails of the metals industry will dampen t  he spirits of those who make it to the annual round of meetings and parties   at London Metal Exchange Week  which starts Monday  20 In what is expected to be a much smaller group of delegates than usual  con  versations will be dominated by fears of global recession smothering alread  y lousy demand  the increasingly pressing need for production cuts  and the   exit of several important participants from the metals business  Cuts in companies  travel budgets and fears of flying are keeping many of t  he usual attendees away from London this year  dealers and analysts said    20  Sentiment is going to be bearish  and we ve just heard in the past few day  s of people who were previously going to come along not coming  largely on   their companies  advice   said Adam Rowley  an analyst at MacQuarie Bank in   London  20 Indeed  a representative at another major bank said fully half of the guest  s expected at its satellite activities have canceled  20 Forecasts for base metals demand and average prices have been widely revise  d downward in the past few weeks  particularly since the impact of the Sept    11 terror attacks accelerated the world economic slowdown  20 Just this week  Standard Bank ratcheted its expectations lower  with LME ca  sh copper   a bellwether for the complex that s especially sensitive to ind  ustrial productivity   seen at  1 350 a metric ton in December 2001  down f  rom an actual year to date average in 2001 of  1 619 ton  20 Producers are reluctant to cut copper output  and declining Chinese imports   and weak demand in the west mean there is still further downside potential   for copper  Standard Bank analyst Robin Bhar said  20 With demand for base metals slumping so sharply  eyes have been turning to   the producers to make moves on the supply side  20 In copper  analysts say U S  producers are the most likely to cut back  as   the recent strength in the dollar hits their bottom line the hardest  Howev  er  a recent slump in energy prices has kept the wolves from the door so fa  r for some producers in an industry that s energy intensive  20 Elsewhere  zinc is suffering from a supply glut that recently pressured the   LME three month price to a 17 year low of  766 a metric ton  20 The troubles of Australian zinc producer Pasminco Ltd   A PAS  will surely   be a hot topic  following the company s move to voluntary administration du  e to its large debt load  dealers said  20 But aside from all the market concerns  the most worrisome topic will likel  y be the recent succession of companies bailing out of or reducing their co  mmitment to the metals business  market participants said  20 In the past week  N M  Rothschild   Sons Ltd  quit the base metals business   and ScotiaMocatta   the metals trading arm of the Bank of Nova Scotia  T B  NS    removed itself from open outcry ring trade at the LME  Earlier this m  onth  Enron Metals said it would cut staff by 10  20  in Europe  and all th  ese moves follow Mitsui Bussan Commodities Ltd  ditching its market making   activities in the metals business earlier this year  20 Who s next  20  It could be anyone

10 17 2001 Reuters English News Service  C  Reuters Limited 2001  HOUSTON  Oct 17  Reuters    Enron Corp  moved in the right direction by releasing more detailed financial data and tackling problems at peripheral businesses  but the energy giant still has a way to go to make Wall Street happy  analysts said Wednesday   Enron  North America s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity  reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on Tuesday  The company took  1 01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill fated investments  measures Enron executives said credit rating agencies were comfortable with  UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said on Wednesday he was  not thrilled  by the announcement during a conference call to discuss third quarter earnings  And for good reason   Moody s Investors Service subsequently issued a statement saying it had placed all of Enron s long term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade    There appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved   Barone said   The writedowns on poorly performing assets and a more detailed breakdown of the company s operations went some way to appeasing Wall Street after a tumultuous year in which Enron s stock lost about two thirds of its value  but analysts said they were not about to let Enron off the hook just yet   Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters said he remained concerned about Enron s quality of earnings and cash flow   Winters said he believed Enron would have liked to take even bigger charges and writedowns  but was unable to do so without putting its credit ratings at risk  which could adversely affect some of the company s financing arrangements    Problem assets and overvalued assets on the balance sheet remain  particularly overseas   he said   One such asset is Enron s 65 percent stake  valued at  1 billion  in the Dabhol power plant project in India  which has been stalled because of a long running payments dispute with its only customer  a local utility company   Enron s stock closed down  1 64  or 4 85 percent  at  32 20 on Wednesday   For the year to date the stock is down about 61 percent  underperforming the Standard   Poor s utilities index   which has fallen some 24 percent over the same period   Enron was a Wall Street favorite last year when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent  driven by enthusiasm for the company s broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform   But the stock has fallen sharply this year as sentiment toward broadband soured  new chief executive Jeff Skilling resigned after just six months in the job and wrangling continued over the Dabhol power plant project

Reuters Limited 2001  NEW YORK  Oct 17  Reuters    Energy companies said the future development of new power plants and transmission lines in the U S  Northeast hinges  in part  on setting up a Northeast Regional Transmission Organization  RTO    RTOs are predominantly for profit groups established to bring all of a region s high voltage transmission lines under central control while ensuring equal access to the lines to all power suppliers seeking to market their goods across the grid  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC   which oversees the interstate wholesale power market  believes RTOs will benefit consumers by enhancing competition among power providers  in turn improving service and driving down rates    If FERC can drive the Northeast RTO to closure in a reasonable period of time  it will accelerate the development of new transmission and generation   Enron Corp  s managing director of global government affairs  Rick Shapiro  told Reuters   Houston based Enron is the nation s top energy marketer    How and when the RTO gets implemented will radically impact the market  It s crucial to the development of the market in New England   Mirant Corp  spokesman Ray Long told Reuters   Energy provider Mirant  of Atlanta  has 1 400 megawatts  MW  of generation in New England  The company is currently adding another 700 MW to its Canal station in Massachusetts    Once we get the permits for Canal  we will reassess whether to proceed with the project  A big part of that assessment will depend on the RTO process   Long said   THE NORTHEAST RTO  FERC wants to see four super regional RTOs created in the U S    in the Northeast  Midwest  Southeast and West   Several regions have taken long strides toward developing RTOs  including a not for profit model proposed in the Midwest and rival for profit plans vying for FERC approval in the West   FERC Chairman Patrick Wood  seeking to spur the development of RTOs  favors giving utilities until Dec  15 to join one or forfeit their right to sell electricity in the wholesale market  though the commission has not voted on this plan   The Northeast RTO will include New England  New York  the Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland  PJM  region and possibly parts of eastern Canada   FERC said it wants the Northeast RTO to be built on the PJM market platform and to include the best practices of the New England and New York markets   PJM Interconnection  which operates the power grid in parts of Pennsylvania  New Jersey  Maryland  Delaware  Virginia and Washington  D C   is the nation s only fully functioning RTO    The process FERC set in place to establish one RTO in PJM  New York and New England is going to get us where we need to be in terms of having a vibrant wholesale market   Long said   Long said Mirant determined a single Northeast RTO would save more than  440 million annually by eliminating the  artificial borders that now exist between New York  New England and PJM    An administrative law judge  acting as a mediator for FERC  considered three proposals for creating the Northeast RTO   The three plans were proposed by interested parties  including Mirant and Enron  and the region s grid operators   the New York Independent System Operator  ISO  in New York  ISO New England in New England and PJM   Last month  the judge asked the FERC to decide who will govern the Northeast RTO and what the timetable is to put the plan in place  The judge favored a plan put forward by the New York ISO and ISO New England    If FERC implements the RTO plan proposed by PJM in 2003  consumers could save  1 5 billion      440 million a year     over the New York New England plan  which would not be implemented until 2006   Long said   Under the PJM plan  PJM would overlay its current market model across the entire region  while adopting some of the best practices of the other markets    Although nothing is perfect  PJM is widely accepted as the best market in the region  New York and New England  which are younger markets  are still works in progress with some bugs to work out   Enron s Shapiro said     Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights

nation s largest natural gas trading company  isn t ready to let the regular report on U S  natural gas storage inventory die  a company executive said Tuesday   Because the American Gas Association has said it will discontinue its weekly gas storage report at the end of the year  Enron would like to see another organization take over the report  said John Lavorato  president and chief executive of the company s Americas Wholesale Services unit  Speaking at a meeting with analysts  Lavorato said the storage report is important for the gas industry to keep track of industry fundamentals   Without a regular report on storage gas inventory  the gas industry can expect less frequent but greater price changes than seen in the past  he said   The Department of Energy s Energy Information Administration publishes monthly data on gas storage  but the information isn t as timely as data the AGA reports each Wednesday   The EIA issued its latest gas storage report Oct  9  It showed the amount of gas in storage at the end of July  The data comes from reports filed by operators of gas storage facilities   It also showed estimates of the amount of gas in storage at the end of August and September  Those estimates are generated by a computer model   Wednesday s weekly storage report from the AGA will show estimated inventory as of Oct  12  The AGA estimate is based on reports from gas storage facilities  That data is then run through an AGA computer model to generate the report   Lavorato said he would like to see the EIA  the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America or consultants like PIRA Energy Group  an international energy consulting firm  take over reports on storage inventory   INGAA is an industry trade group representing gas pipeline companies in the U S   Canada and Mexico  They manage many of the gas storage facilities   Lavorato would like to see a new report based on data that could be audited  he said   He said he thinks the AGA has found itself  in the middle of something it didn t want to be in   Originally intended for use within the gas industry  the weekly AGA report has become high profile  and is even watched by equity markets  he said   Some industry participants have criticized the AGA report  wondering whether it can be manipulated by companies that supply data to the AGA  Many of those companies also trade physical gas and gas futures   When the AGA has revised storage figures from previous reports  gas prices have sometimes reacted wildly     By Michael Rieke  Dow Jones Newswires  713 547 9207  michael rieke dowjones com

FERC Seat  White House Says 2001 10 17 16 09  New York   Bush to Nominate Kelliher to Open FERC Seat  White House Says       Washington  Oct  17  Bloomberg     President George W  Bush will nominate Joseph Kelliher  a policy adviser to U S  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham  to fill the open seat on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  the White House said       If the Senate approves Kelliher  a former Republican counsel for the House Energy and Commerce Committee  the commission will have its full five members for the first time since Pat Wood  Bush s first FERC appointee  became chairman Sept  1          I hope they speed him through the process    said Commissioner Nora Brownell  a Republican who was appointed by Bush earlier this year    He is a thoughtful person who knows how to work through issues         Kelliher s nomination comes as the commission has pledged to closely monitor and investigate abuses in the electricity and natural gas markets and promote competition  In the next month or so  it is due to choose which groups will run the electric power grid around the country  an important step in deregulating the nation s power markets        A former power industry lobbyist  Kelliher would fill the opening left by the departure of Curt Hebert  a Republican appointed by President Bill Clinton and named chairman by Bush  Hebert left the commission Aug  31 to join Entergy Corp  after the White House made it clear Bush planned to make Wood the chairman  With Kelliher  FERC will have three Republicans and two Democrats          Kelliher will be a valuable final addition to the team now working actively to finish the transition to truly competitive and dynamic power markets    said the Electric Power Supply Association  which represents

Power Sales 2001 10 17 14 59  New York   Energy Regulators May Loosen Price Caps on Western Power Sales       Washington  Oct  17  Bloomberg     Federal regulators are considering changes to wholesale price caps on electricity in California and 10 Western states  which power producers hope will allow them to charge more when supplies in the region are tight        The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission plans a public conference Oct  29 to discuss altering the pricing formula  The commission established caps in April and June  after skyrocketing electricity costs led to insolvency for California s largest utilities  units of PG E Corp  and Edison International          We have heard and understand that people do think the solution was very California centric  and it was    FERC Chairman Pat Wood said  indicating changes in the formula are likely    But California s needs were very urgent at the time          While commissioners declined to say what they would be willing to change about the pricing formula  they want to fine  tune the caps before the winter  which is the peak period of demand and may yet cause another jump in prices  Wood said  Changes could be made next month        The current pricing formula is based on the most expensive power generated in California  Enron Corp   Sierra Pacific Resources and other sellers of power to California want the formula to consider costs from all generators in the region        Enron blamed the formula for a July 2 blackout in Nevada  when sellers withheld supply because local prices were too low based on the highest cost of supply then being offered in California                            Lower Power Costs       Though the cost of wholesale power in California has dropped since the commission ordered the first emergency cap on April 25  Wood said the Western states may face another shortage of power and high prices this winter        The Pacific Northwest depends on hydropower for much of its energy needs  and rainfall has been below normal this year  Part of the shortfall in power last year and early this year was the result of a drought that reduced power available from dams          I remain concerned about that part of the country    Wood said    It has not been raining a whole lot out there          The average price for a megawatt hour at the California  Oregon border in September was  24 91  down from  313 70 in April  A megawatt hour is enough electricity to power about 750 average California homes for an hour        On the agenda for this month s conference is a proposal to link the formula to the price of natural gas  a fuel used in many generating plants          I m not predisposed for or against specific changes    said FERC Commissioner Nora Brownell  The Oct  29 conference will help the commission determine aspects of the price control that the parties involved agree are working and those that are not  she said                                Surcharge       In a related matter  the commission also may halt the 10 percent surcharge it permits generators to charge in California to cover the costs of collecting bad debt  The insolvent California utilities now have plans to pay off their debts        For power sellers in the West  the current price caps often require utilities to sell their excess power at a loss  Enron  Sierra Pacific and other marketers said in statements to the commission  They said the price they sometimes pay for power is higher than the cost of supply from the most expensive producer in California          The determination of the proxy price should not be limited to California generators    Enron said in a government filing  It should be   determined by the least efficient generator in the entire West          Power marketers also should be allowed to recover   justifiable costs above the proxy prices    Enron wrote        California officials had demanded the price controls after PG E s Pacific Gas   Electric and Edison s Southern California Edison racked up more than  14 billion in power buying losses        The caps were extended to other Western states    Oregon  Washington  Arizona  Nevada  Wyoming  New Mexico  Colorado  Montana  Idaho and Utah    in June because some said generators in the West could simply get around the cap by selling outside California when prices were higher elsewhere  The caps don t expire until Sept  30  2002  though they can be changed        California said before the price cap was extended to other states that it sometimes had to outbid buyers in neighboring states at prices above the caps to buy enough electricity to avoid blackouts        On July 2  Sierra Pacific cut supplies to 10 000 customers for 45 minutes when temperatures soared and three power plants were idled  It couldn t buy 50 megawatts of power in the spot market  partly because of suppliers  concerns with the federal cap  company spokesman Paul Heagan said at the time

work across the U S  is our number one objective   Shapiro said   Enron has a large stake in the regulatory debate  With wide ranging commodity positions from lumber to pulp to bandwidth  oil and natural gas  its strategy hinges on the ability to transfer those products from buyer to seller more cheaply and quickly than its competitors   For the power market  that means Enron needs easy access to electric transmission lines  the interstate highway system that allows it to wheel supplies between regions and capitalize on short term price imbalances   UTILITIES BLOCK COMPETITION  Enron s big problem  Traditional utilities own transmission lines and have shaped the rules to block new entrants and favor their own generation  Shapiro said    Vertically integrated monopolies have been very effective in delaying wholesale competition across the board   he said   In its pleas to Supreme Court justices and regulators  Enron has tried to empower federal regulators to force utilities to open their wires to competition   The Supreme Court last week heard oral arguments in a case that could be a watershed for the U S  power industry and decide whether FERC has the right to drive competition on state transmission networks   In a classic battle of state versus federal jurisdictional turf  Enron wants the court to give FERC more authority to compel states to open their transmission grids to competitors   Meanwhile  New York has brought a companion case that says FERC has gone too far and the court should give control of transmission wires back to the states    This is an example of an agency that has overstepped its bounds   Lawrence Malone  general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission  said at the oral argument   New York wants the court to revoke FERC s authority to regulate retail sales  contending electricity involved in such sales stays within state boundaries and is not subject to federal legislation    I think a victory for New York would be absolutely disastrous for consumers across the country   Shapiro said    FERC has jurisdiction  All they need to do is exercise it   Shapiro said  echoing Enron lawyers  case to Supreme Court justices that existing laws give FERC the power to do Enron s will   Enron does not see a recent congressional push for energy legislation as key to its plans  Shapiro said   FERC is doing its job on the electricity front  I m not sure that legislation is required on that front    FERC SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS  With new Chairman Pat Wood at the helm  FERC is moving in the right direction to drive competition  Shapiro said   It s early in his tenure   Shapiro said of Wood   Many of the signs are promising    Wood has made so called regional transmission organizations a high priority and set aggressive agency rules to drive utilities to join them   RTOs establish common rules that allow utilities to smoothly trade bulk electricity across the borders of their own local transmission systems  Enron sees RTOs as a positive step toward competition   In what he called a  carrots and sticks  approach  Wood signaled in late September that utilities must either join RTOs or face losing the right to sell power in wholesale markets   FERC will hold a week long meeting on RTOs beginning Monday   Enron is skeptical that carrots are useful  and is a bigger fan of sticks  Shapiro said   Utilities have  gotten quite fat over the last nine or 10 years   Shapiro said  and will shrug off FERC s incentives   I m not sure there are a sufficient number of carrots in the world right now to incentivize these companies   Shapiro said   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved     UK  Enron s European electricity trading volumes soar   10 12 2001 Reuters English News Service  C  Reuters Limited 2001   LONDON  Oct 12  Reuters    U S  energy group Enron on Friday said it traded five times as much wholesale electricity in continental Europe during the first half of this year as in the same period last year   Continental power trading director Gregor Baeumerich told Reuters the company traded 523 terawatt hours in the first half   roughly equivalent to annual German power demand   up from 93 terawatt hours in the first half of 2000   On average we are now doing around 200 deals a day with about 300 counterparties   he said   Liquidity in Germany  Europe s biggest power market  had risen partly due to more trading by municipal utilities  he said   Baeumerich said volumes in the French power market had risen sharply in recent weeks after Electricite de France last month auctioned off access to 1 200 megawatts of it generation capacity   He said annual contracts for physical baseload power for 2002 were trading daily  Up to 30 companies participated in the French market    Utilities from across the continent are trading the French market   said Baeumerich   Much of the trading took place on France s borders with neighbouring countries  he said

Reuters English News Service  C  Reuters Limited 2001   LONDON  Oct 12  Reuters    Electronic trading of base metals futures has established a firm foothold in the market but the nature of online trading platforms looks set to evolve further  says Gavin Gross  head of LME metals at Spectron Futures Ltd   UK based energy and commodities broker Spectron s electronic platform for the trading of London Metal Exchange  LME  contracts has become required viewing for traders alongside the LME s own system LME Select and the Enron Group s EnronOnline   I think we ve proved that people will trade LME derivatives contracts online  because there are some great advantages to doing so   Gross told Reuters in a telephone interview    And unlike the physical markets  where things haven t really taken off online  all three platforms are pretty much indispensable to the market    Both Spectron and LME Select are neutral platforms in which Category 1 and Category 2 LME members trade with each other  while EnronOnline is open to a wider membership but has Enron itself as the sole counterparty in each transaction   This leaves a gap in the market for a multi party trading system open to industry participants beyond the immediate trading community  Gross suggested    I think the clear trend for metals derivatives trading for the future is for open platforms which would allow dealers and clients in the market to interact with each other online   he said   Direct access for clients to an electronic trading environment could mean changes in the role of the broker  he said    Clients will have the advantage of more control  more visibility and more transparency in what they do  However  they ll have to pay for services   Gross said    You could see a situation where dealers specialise in different areas   certain dealers would provide credit functions  certain institutions would provide clearing  others would provide execution and certain companies would provide market making    DIFFICULT CONDITIONS  Difficult market conditions are already forcing metals traders to rethink their activities  this week alone has seen N M  Rothschild   Sons exit base metals trading and both Bank of Nova Scotia and Enron looking to scale back    On the LME now you ve got low volumes  falling volatilities  falling prices and we re in the grips of a bear market  It s very  very poor for business in general   Gross said    There are too many dealers around chasing a shrinking amount of business   Each company is going to have to look very carefully at their business and their staffing levels    Spectron has not been immune from declining volumes    Our volumes for the first 12 months of operation were fantastic  way beyond what we had expected  However  our volumes have fallen in the recent quarter   Gross said    That s due to two factors  first  the overall market activity is lower  and second LME Select has managed to attract some of the business that we would previously have had 100 percent of    The company is now looking at ways to further develop its trading platform    We re beginning to investigate ways to add certain features and do things differently  That might involve creating an alternative platform where clients could access prices and thereby widen the service   Gross said   But  he stressed   we have to keep the interests of our dealer clients foremost    UNCERTAINTY  In the current environment  the LME s refusal to throw its weight behind either open outcry floor trade or its new screen system   the exchange has taken pains not to express any preference and to  allow the market to decide    may prove to be counterproductive  Gross said    By having two systems running side by side     the exchange is almost moving in two totally different directions   he said    There s a feeling that the ring is doomed  which doesn t do anything to encourage its use  while the reluctance to fully back electronic trading means that you re still only seeing a trickle of business going through Select in terms of overall volumes    While preferences vary in different sectors of the market  the current uncertainty is helping no one  he said    Metals traders just want to trade  They just want to know with some kind of certainty how the market will be structured in future so they can structure their business to support that and

reduced its shareholder equity by 1 2 bln usd as the company decided to repurchase 55 mln of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer  Andrew Fastow  the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition   Enron did not disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday  when the Houston based energy giant announced a 1 01 bln usd charge to third quarter earnings that produced a 618 mln usd loss  However  the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday  As a result of the reduction  Enron s shareholder equity dropped to 9 5 bln usd  the company said   In an interview  Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said about 35 mln usd of the 1 01 bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co Investment LP  a limited partnership created and run by Fastow   In a conference call yesterday with investors  Lay said 55 mln shares had been repurchased by Enron  as the company  unwound  its participation in the transactions  In the third quarter  the company s average number of shares outstanding was 913 mln   According to Rick Causey  Enron s chief accounting officer  these shares were contributed to a  structured finance vehicle  set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors  In exchange for the stock  the entity provided Enron with a note   The aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of Enron s broadband telecommunications and other technology investments  Causey did not elaborate on what form those hedges took   Subsequently  both the value of Enron s stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply  the report said  As a result  Enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares  When Enron reacquired the shares  it also canceled the note it had received from the entity   Given all the complexities of the LJM related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company   the confusion factor wasn t worth the trouble of trying to continue this   Causey said   Mark Palmer  an Enron spokesman  described the capital reduction  as just a balance sheet issue  and therefore was not deemed  material  for disclosure purposes   gc For more information and to contact AFX  www afxnews com and www afxpress com    Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved

2001 Reuters English News Service  C  Reuters Limited 2001  HOUSTON  Oct 18  Reuters    Enron Corp  stock fell sharply on Thursday as investors digested news of a  1 2 billion reduction in the energy giant s shareholder equity that attracted little attention when it was first disclosed earlier this week   In afternoon trading Enron s stock was off  2 96 or  9 2 percent at  29 24 per share  Enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years on Tuesday after taking charges of  1 01 billion against earnings to cover expenses and writedowns on investments that fall outside its core wholesale energy operations   The reduction in shareholder equity was not mentioned in the company s earnings statement but was discussed by Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay in an earnings conference call with analysts and investors on Tuesday    Confidence has been shaken by the incremental disclosure  This is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much   said one analyst who asked not to be identified   The reduction in equity was prominently reported in the Wall Street journal on Thursday  bringing it to the attention of a wider audience  analysts said   Lay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of Enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some Wall Street analysts   As a result of the operation  Enron s debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about 50 percent  but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around 40 percent by the end of next year  Lay said   Moody s Investor Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron s long term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially reduced valuations for several Enron businesses   Some of Enron s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings     Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved          Brazil s Copene  Elektro Plan to Sell 820 Mln

  c  2001 Financial Times Limited   All Rights Reserved  Enron  the US energy group and trader  yesterday confirmed it would cut 500 jobs  or 10 per cent of its European workforce  in an attempt to improve profits   Ken Lay  Enron s chairman  is under pressure to restore the company s share price  which has slid more than 60 per cent in the past 12 months  The cuts  flagged last week  will scale back operations Mr Lay had previously said would be critical to the company s future growth  John Sherriff  Enron Europe s president  said business continued to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions  but the company was  seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth    Enron Europe has 5000 employees  Mr Sherriff said the headcount would be cut by between 5 and 10 per cent  and the company hoped to achieve this through voluntary severance   Gordon Howald  an energy analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities in New York  said Enron had been criticised over its strategy to increase cash flows    They are trying to slash their workforce and are selling Portland General Electric  This is good timing  When financials are under pressure  it probably makes good sense   he said  adding there had been rumours of US job cuts  outside of the previously announced Broadband division job cuts in July   Enron yesterday denied there were further job cuts planned in the US   Last week Enron said it had agreed to sell the electricity utility Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas for  1 8bn  a disposal it had been planning for some time   Enron shares closed  1 81  or 5 4 per cent  higher at  35 20 in New York yesterday    c  Copyright Financial Times Ltd  All rights reserved   http   www ft com   Copyright

2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News  Source  World Reporter  TM   In college  they call it grading on the curve  In business  it s known as forced ranking   In both cases  regardless of performance  someone s going to fail  The practices reward those who perform better than their peers  That s the American way  But they also can punish those doing good work    just not as good as others  In college  grading on the curve means failing a course despite learning the material and either being forced to repeat it or flunking out  In business  forced ranking means that every year some arbitrary number    often 10 percent    get put on notice that they must improve  Or sometimes they get fired   Traditionally  business has used competency based evaluations of employees  That is  can they do the work  Forced ranking sets up a totem pole  Everyone has a place on that pole  from the top to the bottom   And the pole gets chopped off from the bottom   About 20 percent of American companies use forced ranking  according to an article on the subject in the Harvard Management Update  a newsletter from the publishing arm of the business school   Some companies used forced ranking only for top managers  Others use the system for all managers  or all exempt employees who are not on hourly wages   Some of the most admired companies use the process    General Electric  for example  Here in Houston  Enron uses a five point scale with 15 percent in the bottom ranking   Proponents of forced ranking say it makes managers confront a perennial problem  that of low performing managers and employees   Not only do the low performers cause problems now  If they neither improve nor leave  they block promotion for people who might do a better job   Productivity and morale sag  Fewer top people want to join the company  The best performers leave   In what seems to be the endless American cycle of hiring and layoffs  forced ranking also gives managers some objective criteria to use when it s once again time to let people go   But forced ranking also can raise the usual cries of discrimination that any ranking system brings  At Microsoft  an African American plaintiff sued  claiming his low ranking came because of his race  At Ford Motor Co   which has dropped forced ranking  the charges of discrimination came from middle aged white males   Forced ranking has provided a much needed boost at some companies    ones that have not confronted performance problems of managers over the years   Still  after a few cycles of forced ranking  companies must decide what s next  So you ve weeded out the slackers  You ve helped those who needed help to improve their performance  Overall  the company is doing a much better job of getting the products or services out the door   Inevitably  companies will reach a point of diminishing returns  If every manager or exempt employee is at least competent at his or her job  is it really worth it to rate and arbitrarily fire 10 percent or so of them every year   Sure  that s going to keep everyone on their toes as they scramble to keep their jobs  But it may not be all that good in encouraging teamwork   And  as France s army found in World War I  the practice of decimation    arbitrarily shooting 10 percent of your own troops to encourage the others to fight harder    does not tend to raise morale   Forced ranking also seems to me to be based on the wrong premise    that is  that companies need to be filled with high performance people from top to bottom to succeed   That may not necessarily be true  Every organization really needs a mix of people  For example  organizations need a leavening of malcontents  They stir up things  get people thinking  challenge assumptions  Yet an organization composed of nothing but malcontents won t work   Sure  every company needs top performers  They are the yeast that causes the organization to rise  But companies also need the steady and the sturdy and people with limited imagination to take care of the millions of details that must be faced every day   It s the equivalent of taking out the trash  It s not inspiring work  but unless it gets done  it gets smelly   Comments  Telephone 713 220 2000 and touch code 1000  Send e mail to jim barlow chron com   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved     India  Greenfield Shipping rejects German bailout offer  10 11 2001 Business Line  The Hindu  Fin  Times Info Ltd Asia Africa Intel Wire  Business Line  The Hindu  Copyright  C  2001 Kasturi   Sons Ltd  All Rights Res d  NEW DELHI  Oct  10 IN a fresh twist to the crisis facing the  220 million LNG shipping deal for Dabhol Power Company  German based KG Finance Group has made a proposal to the promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company to bail out the project    The promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company  however  rejected the proposal ab initio   sources familiar with the developments told Business Line  The bailout proposal was made by the German agency during discussions held in London recently between the representatives of the three promoters  Mitsui O S K  Lines  SCI and Atlantic Commercial Inc  and the lending consortium led by ANZ Investment Bank   As per the offer  the KG Finance Group would facilitate the completion of the 137 000 cubic metre capacity tanker to be used for transporting LNG from Oman to Enron s power plant at Dabhol   The LNG carrier would be converted into a German asset by bringing it under a special purpose vehicle  SPV  registered in Germany  The tanker would be operated by German crew   The Greenfield Shipping Company is registered in the Cayman Islands and would fly a Maltese flag  The German entity had also proposed to tie up finances for the entire arrangement through a mix of public and private funding   KG Finance Group was of the view that the Greenfield Shipping Company had paid an  unbelievably higher price  for the LNG tanker by contracting it a rate of  220 million  In its reckoning  the vessel building price was at least  15 to 20 million higher than the market price prevailing then   Against this backdrop  KG Finance Group had told the representatives of the Greenfield Shipping Company assembled in London that the tanker would fetch not more than  65 000 per day as charter hire rates  the sources said  This was against the charter hire rate of  98 600 per day agreed with Dabhol Power Company   The German agency had also said that it would charge a commission of 3 per cent for finalising the deal   The proposal was turned down by the promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company on the grounds that transferring the asset from a Maltese flag to a German flag would deprive the tanker of depreciation benefits    Besides  the project will not break even at a charter hire rate of  65 000 per day   the sources said   The offer made by KG Finance Group comes in the wake of a crisis facing the promoters of the LNG shipping project after the lenders suspended the last tranche of the project loan of  55 million  citing an event of default   The project promoters will not be able to take possession of the LNG carrier if the remaining project cost of  55 million is not paid to the shipbuilding yard  The crisis has been compounded by the fact that Enron is planning to exit from the project by selling its 20 per cent stake in the venture   While various permutations and combinations have been discussed between the joint venture partners  nothing has taken a concrete shape so far  dragging the venture into deeper uncertainty   While making its offer  the German entity had drawn attention to the not so rosy LNG market globally  The LNG vessel prices are now ruling at about  165 million    Besides  about 24 LNG vessels are lying idle world  over  Even two new vessels delivered recently are lying idle without any commitment to charter   the sources said  pointing to the bleak scenario prevailing at the moment which has steeply driven down the charter hire rates for LNG ships   P  Manoj  Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved     CM rejects NCP plea for probe into Enron dispute  10 11 2001 The Times of India Copyright  C  2001 The Times of India  Source  World Reporter  TM   MUMBAI  Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has rejected a demand by the Nationalist Congress party  NCP  for reconsideration of a judicial probe being set up into the Enron controversy   Mr Deshmukh told a press conference here on Wednesday    As far as we are concerned  the issue of a judicial probe into Enron is over    Deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal  sitting adjacent to him  kept mum when Mr Deshmukh s attention was drawn to the demand by the NCP  the principal partner of the ruling Democratic Front   NCP president Sharad Pawar had stated at a public meeting last week that his party would not be responsible if the state had to pay arbitration costs to Enron running into hundreds of crores of rupees  Similarly  NCP spokesman Vasant Chavan had alleged that the decision to institute the judicial probe needed to be reconsidered   Mr Deshmukh s outright rejection of the demand could be another reason for tension between the Congress and the NCP  sources said   Hiking of water supply charges by the DF government is another major issue that has been hanging fire  Maharashtra Pradesh Congress committee president Govindrao Adik and other leaders had attacked the government s decision to the hike  When Mr Deshmukh was asked to state the government s response  he announced that the matter would be referred to the DF coordination committee   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved     Former Enron Broadband Services Asia CEO Joins

Puts Wholesale Operation Behind Growth Targets By Jon Kamp Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  10 10 2001 Dow Jones Energy Service  Copyright  c  2001  Dow Jones   Company  Inc    COLUMBUS  Ohio   Dow Jones   Top officials from American Electric Power Co   AEP  outlined the utility s growth objectives in a conference with financial analysts Wednesday  emphasizing its plan to lean on wholesale operations for future growth   AEP also noted how a planned corporate separation plan  expected to wrap up by the end of 2001 pending regulatory approval  will help by separating and clearly defining the company s unregulated operations   That is clearly going to be the major growth driver for AEP   said Henry Fayne  executive vice president at AEP and the newly named head of the company s regulated operations  Fayne is also the outgoing chief financial officer at AEP   AEP officials said the company is targeting 8  earnings per share growth on a year to year basis for an undefined period  Because regulated utility operations are typically a slow growth business  AEP expects wholesale operations to increase their contribution to earnings by at least 10  each year going forward   On a shorter term basis  Fayne reiterated AEP s guidance for 2001 earnings in the  3 50 to  3 60 a diluted share range  A poll of 12 analysts by Thomson Financial First Call  by comparison  shows the company earning  3 59 a diluted share for the year   AEP also maintained its 2002 earnings guidance  though it said a planned power plant acquisition announced this week should boost results by at least six cents  The company said Monday that it plans to buy two 2 000 megawatt coal fired power plants in the U K  from Edison International s  EIX  Edison Mission Energy unit for  960 million   With that deal  2002 earnings should fall into the  3 80 to  3 90 a diluted share range  Fayne said  A Thomson Financial First Call poll of 13 analysts puts 2002 earnings at  3 88 a diluted share   To achieve its longer term targets  AEP plans to lean heavily on its expanding wholesale trading operations  Currently  the company is the second largest wholesale electricity trader in the U S  after Enron Corp   ENE   and it ranks in the top ten in natural gas trading   The company expects to become a top five natural gas trader as early as the fourth quarter this year  and to continue expanding electricity trading as the market evolves  And the company s aggressive growth plans shouldn t be deterred by current weakness in natural gas prices  or by wholesale power prices that are barely above generation costs in key U S  markets  said Eric van der Walde  executive vice president of marketing and trading at AEP   The company continues to move into new markets and to use sophisticated analysis to devise market strategies  and because it isn t simply trying to sell electricity above cost  it isn t held back by sluggish markets  van der Walde said    It s not negative for us to have markets where the prices are declining   he said   Fayne also noted that the performance at AEP s fleet continues to improve  which effectively adds more megawatts to its portfolio  Power plants in the company s eastern Midwest base  where it operates nearly 24 000 megawatts of power  ran at 91 8  capacity in 2001  up from 87 6  capacity a year ago  The company expects continued improvement for 2001   Aside from the U K  power plant acquisition plan announced this week  AEP said it remains open to other future power plant purchases  Though the company doesn t believe it needs to always own power plants in areas where it markets power  like the West Coast  owning assets in those areas can still be helpful  said E  Linn Draper  AEP s president and chief executive    We would be open to the idea of trading something here for something somewhere else   Draper said   Nothing is sacred in terms of the portfolio  Anything is fair game    The company does plan in the near term to hold on to its large Cook nuclear plant  a 2 110 megawatt generator in Michigan that regained full operations at the beginning of 2001 after a three year outage  Draper said  But because there has been so much consolidation in the nuclear power industry  the company is open to considering some method of outside management that might allow it to share resources with other nuclear utilities    By Jon Kamp  Dow Jones Newswires

will be transported between the two through a pipeline for which technical bids have already been submitted   The pipeline will then continue overland to Oman and from there to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline  The extension to Pakistan is expected to cost up to an additional three billion dollars   lp dab  Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved     BUSINESS   TECHNOLOGY NATURAL GAS BIG IN STATE S FUTURE   NEW PIPELINES ARE PROPOSED TO FILL NEEDS Antonio Fins Business Writer  10 14 2001 South Florida Sun Sentinel Broward Metro 1H  Copyright 2001 by the Sun Sentinel   Prodded by rules requiring cleaner air and bolstered by a series of competing pipeline proposals  natural gas is set to become a major player in Florida s energy grid   The state Public Service Commission projects that by the end of the decade  natural gas will account for 44 percent of the fuel used by Florida utilities  up from about 18 percent now  Utility companies use 85 percent of the natural gas burned in Florida  As energy companies bid for the right to drill for oil and gas 100 miles off Florida s coast  other businesses are betting big dollars on natural gas   Gulfstream Natural Gas System is already building a pipeline from Mississippi and Alabama across the Gulf of Mexico and into the Tampa area  Enron Corp  of Houston is proposing to spend as much as  400 million to build a pipeline from the Bahamas Port Everglades   Enron s proposal is drawing rivals  El Paso Corp   also in Houston  wants to build a Bahamas to South Florida pipeline that comes ashore in West Palm Beach  And AES Corp  has purchased Ocean Cay  a speck of an island near Bimini in the Bahamas for an energy complex that will include a power plant and a gas pipeline to Port Everglades   The proposals are receiving scrutiny from county officials and environmental groups  Ultimately  federal regulators must give their approval before a pipeline can be constructed   Still  electric companies  which are proposing to build more than 80 new power plants in Florida through 2010  are looking to make heavy use of natural gas    Practically all the new units are going to burn natural gas   said Michael Haff  an engineer at the PSC   That s the reason for the large increase  in projections of natural gas usage   All this is quite a change for Florida s electric utilities  For decades  power suppliers have found it easier to cart coal and ship oil to burn in Florida s power plants than to pipe in natural gas   Nor has there been much of a popular mandate for natural gas in Florida  Most users are small factories  public laundries and restaurants  where chefs prefer natural gas over electricity because it s easier to control the heat  With little need for heating homes in winter  residential use has generally been limited to barbecues  water heaters and stoves   Consequently  Florida uses far less natural gas than many states  Household use of natural gas is less than one fifth of what some households in other parts of the country use   The motive for the switch comes from a combination of factors  The federal Clean Air act  signed into law in 1990  is forcing utilities across the country to reduce their dependence on coal and oil and to find cleaner sources of fuel to power their generators   Natural gas is one of those options   Alvaro Linero  the administrator who reviews power plants for the state Department of Environmental Protection  said natural gas emits no particulate matter  the tiny particles that can lodge in lungs and aggravate respiratory conditions  Unlike oil or coal  it gives off no sulfur dioxide  which causes acid rain  It is also easier to control nitrogen oxide emissions  a key component of smog  when natural gas is the fuel rather than oil or coal   Florida Power   Light Co   the largest of the electric companies  has already heavily invested in natural gas generators    21 of its 29 non nuclear power plants are able to run on natural gas   FPL said it turns to natural gas occasionally to save customers money  but the utility  regulators and industry groups could not say how much money is saved by the switch   Another factor behind the projected rise in usage of natural gas is its growing availability  By 2005  natural gas supplies are expected to surge after one pipeline  which will run gas across the Gulf of Mexico  is finished  Local government and industry officials also expect the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will give the green light to one of the Bahamas to Florida pipeline projects as well   Still  some environmental groups say that  while they want cleaner energy  they worry that the push to natural gas raises other fears   One concern voiced by civic activists is that the gas pipeline project will create safety hazards at local ports and parks  Enron  which applied to build a Bahamas to Florida pipeline  said it has taken steps to make sure it is safe  But Broward officials and a conservationist group  Hollywood based Save Our Shores  have expressed reservations in filings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  which must approve the pipeline project before construction begins   The safety of natural gas pipelines has received more attention recently  After a pipeline exploded in Carlsbad  N M   last year  killing 12 people  the federal government moved to tighten regulations and require annual testing   And the massive increase in natural gas use by the electric companies dismays some natural gas advocates   They insist the best way to employ it is by piping it directly into homes for water heaters  stoves and even gas run air conditioning units    a more efficient and cost effective use of natural gas than running electric generators  they argue   But state regulators and industry officials say that it is too costly to hook up homes in established neighborhoods because of the expenses in construction and re landscaping  so expecting large numbers of people to convert from electric to gas appliances is unrealistic   Disagreements aside  the consensus is that the state s power utilities and consumers will soon have another fuel and energy option    We don t expect  natural gas usage  to decline  If anything  we may see an increase   said Lance Horton  marketing director for People s Gas Co   At the end of the day  the customer is going to have another choice that was not there before    Staff Writer David Fleshler contributed to this report   Antonio Fins can be reached at afins sun sentinel com 954 356

GATLIN  10 13 2001 Boston Herald All Editions 020  Copyright 2001   Polaroid Corp   one of Massachusetts  most storied innovators  sought bankruptcy protection yesterday in a Delaware court to reorganize its business and will seek to hasten a sale of the company   The highly anticipated move capped a rocky period under Chief Executive Gary DiCamillo and marked an extraordinary fall for the 64  year old Cambridge instant photography legend  The company that helped define Route 128 as America s Technology Highway  slashed thousands of jobs since its peak in 1978  when it employed nearly 21 000   It has local operations in Bedford  Cambridge  New Bedford  Norton  Norwood  Waltham and Wayland   Polaroid already announced plans this year to cut 3 000 jobs and reduce its work force to 5 500  Yesterday  the company said it will cut more   It s been crushed by huge debt and battered by a sharp drop in demand for its mainstay instant film amid a shift to digital technologies and a weak economy    How such a place  with so much success and so much technology  could lose that much money and get into so much debt  I don t understand   said Lloyd Taylor  a retired Polaroid chemist who has also consulted for the company   A lot of people I ve known  both retirees and some that are still there  are just totally demoralized    Polaroid  founded by visionary Edwin H  Land in 1937  said it will remain open for business and continue to make and ship its core instant film products  even as it  accelerates and intensifies  its search for a buyer under bankruptcy court protection   But it will slash operations  with an unspecified number of job cuts expected  Anything that s not part of its core business   products that rely on instant film   is subject to sale or elimination   That

News Service  C  Reuters Limited 2001   LONDON  Oct 12  Reuters    Coalpower  the company set up by former RJB Mining chief Richard Budge  says it would like to build a coal fired power station near its newly acquired Hatfield colliery in South Yorkshire  northern England    We are keen to build a 500 megawatt clean coal power plant and are talking to various people   Budge told Reuters on Thursday  adding the chances of such a station coming to fruition would be closely linked to the outcome of Britain s current review of its energy needs to 2050   Let s see what comes out of the energy review   if it s positive for coal gasification it will not just be our plant that will be built  others will be    Coalpower acquired the Hatfield coal mine on Monday  beating off competition from U S  energy group Enron and UK Coal  formerly RJB Mining  and is spending about five million pounds   8 4 million  to restart production   Budge said Hatfield has the potential to become a long life pit with its 100 million tonnes of contiguous coal reserves and he is looking for output in excess of 500 000 tonnes a year    Hatfield is the optimum site for a coal gasification combined cycle plant   said Budge  adding Britain needed coal generation to maintain a balanced and diverse energy portfolio   The government has said it is concerned about Britain s projected dependence on imported natural gas   Conventional coal burning power stations are high in fossil fuel emissions  which many scientists believe contribute to global warming  But gasification combined cycle technology converts coal to a gaseous fuel from which most of the impurities are removed prior to combustion   Supporters of coal say the clean coal technology can address many of the environmental concerns of burning coal   Coal mining in Britain has been in decline for decades  but the fuel still accounts for about a third of its power generation and recent signs point to the industry enjoying a mini revival   A doubling in the price of British natural gas over the last year has led to a rise in coal demand as electricity generators seek out the cheapest fuel in a highly competitive market  The increased demand for coal has propelled prices to about 35 pounds a tonne compared with 22 50  18 months ago   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved     Enron s Azurix faces

owns Coburg Power  said losing the Texas based conglomerate will not stop the project   Enron never drove this deal   he said   I invited Enron into the deal    Marcus said Enron s participation improved the quality of the plant s design but slowed the decision making process  Marcus predicted he will find a new backer in less than six months and will have a license to build the project within a year   Enron backed out because the project did not meet its market strategy  Marcus said   Enron officials couldn t be reached for comment   Enron s departure will do little to appease local residents  who fear that the power plant will harm ground water and air quality    I don t think it ll ever be built   said Kent Johnston of Coburg  a project opponent   If the people of Coburg and Eugene have anything to say about it  it won t be    Added Joey Gayles  a committee chairman in the residents  opposition group   We re going to fight  Marcus  tooth and nail    The proposed 40 acre site north of Coburg meets all criteria for construction of a 300 megawatt plant on 12 acres of the site  Marcus said  The remainder of the site would be used for buffer area and wetlands mitigation   An additional eight acres will be required for the 600 megawatt plant that Coburg Power wants to build  he said  The larger plant would require additional permits that might delay the project   Expanding the existing natural gas pipeline that runs under the site also would add to the plant s cost  The larger plant would generate the equivalent of all power currently consumed in Lane County   Marcus estimated the cost of the larger plant at  300 million to  400 million  The smaller plant would cost about  180 million  he said   Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights Reserved

Company  in which one of its affiliates  Atlantic Commercial Inc  is a 20 per cent equity partner   While Enron s 20 per cent stake in the  220 million LNG venture for Dabhol Power Company comes to  11 million  the Houston based company is understood to have put up a price of  30 million for exiting from Greenfield  bankers familiar with the developments told Business Line  The  30 million price pegged by Enron for its 20 per cent stake comprises  11 million for equity and  19 million for swapping the company s share of the loan liabilities  the sources said   Though Atlantic Commercial Inc is yet to make an official statement on pulling out of the LNG shipping deal  it is understood to have conveyed to the project lenders led by ANZ Investment Bank that such a decision was imminent in view of Enron s plan to exit from Dabhol Power Company   The State run Shipping Corporation of India  SCI  is a 20 per cent partner in Greenfield  while the remaining 60 per cent equity in the joint venture consortium is held by Japan s Mitsui O S K Lines   In view of the controversy surrounding the power plant  the lenders to the LNG shipping deal have declared an event of default and suspended the last tranche of the project loan worth  55 million  The ANZ Investment Bank led consortium has already pumped in  110 million out of a total loan commitment of  165 million for the 137 000 cubic metre capacity tanker being build at Mitsubishi s yard in Japan   The three promoters will now have to put in additional investments to the tune of  55 million to take possession of the vessel on the scheduled delivery date of November 15   The board of SCI has not been able to come to a conclusion on putting in extra funds in the project despite discussing the issue several times  A board meet held on Tuesday to discuss the issue again ended in stalemate  Government sources said   SCI s dilemma on making extra investments in the project also centre around the fate of Enron s equity in the deal  In the event of Enron pulling out of the LNG shipping project  its 20 per cent equity would have to be taken over by the two remaining partners  Besides  these two partners would also have to pool in the additional investments of  55 million amongst themselves in proportion to their revised equity holdings    However  there is a great question mark over whether Mitsui and SCI should agree to take over the equity of Enron   the sources said   During discussions held in London recently  Mitsui had clearly told the lenders that it was not in favour of putting in extra funds to salvage the LNG shipping deal   Moreover  with the consortium now looking at a charter hire rate of  60 000 to  65 000 per day as against the rate of  98 600 per day agreed with Dabhol Power Company  both SCI and Mitsui feels that the revised charter hire rates would render their investments unviable   According to estimates  at a charter hire rate of  60 000 per day  Greenfield is expected to earn about  22 million per annum  Out of this   4  5 million will be spent on operating expenses of the tanker   The remaining  17 18 million will fetch an internal rate of return  IRR  of 7 8 per cent for Mitsui at an equity stake of 60 per cent    Mitsui feels that an IRR of this level was not sufficient for their investments   the sources said   Whereas  for SCI  the investments would fetch a return of 4 4 5 per cent   This will be far below the Government norm of 12 per cent IRR for projects involving State funding   the sources said   P  Manoj  Copyright   2000 Dow Jones   Company  Inc  All Rights

order said  The three arbitrations relate to State guarantees to the project  A DPC spokesman said now  the arbitration process in London would continue as originally contemplated and agreed by the State Government and DPC  This has no bearing on the on going proceedings involving DPC  MSEB and MERC before the Mumbai High Court and Supreme Court    He also said Maharashtra is not a party to any of the on going proceedings before the Mumbai High Court and the Supreme Court   Over the past few months  the State Government and other Government entities have taken actions to avoid complying with their contractual obligations   This has frustrated the rights of international investors that were legally agreed to by the relevant parties several years ago  The injunction facilitates the timely and impartial review by the international arbitration panel of the dispute between DPC and the State   the company said   The arbitration panel had been constituted sometime ago and proceedings were expected to begin any time   However  the proceedings could not take off as a dispute over the jurisdiction of the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission had dragged on to the Mumbai High Court and then the Supreme Court   Both courts had restrained DPC from continuing international arbitration pending resolution of the MERC jurisdiction issue  The State Government was expected to file a civil suit in the Mumbai High Court accusing the company of fraud and misrepresentation  Internal differences in the Government and the legal team over proving  fraud  had led to the resignation of

with a related party have tarnished Enron s  ENE NYSE   news   commentary  reputation and crushed its stock  but it looks like that case is far from unique   The battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities  according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing Enron  Moreover  Enron s new CFO  who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related party dealings of his predecessor  serves on 12 of these entities  And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston based related entity called ES Power 3   The extent of Enron s dealings with these companies  or the value of its holdings in them  couldn t be immediately determined  But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors  fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don t show up on its balance sheet  If that s so  the company s financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street  where the company was long treated with kid gloves   Enron didn t immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer  Jeff McMahon  in the various entities  Enron s board members couldn t immediately be reached for comment   Ten Long Days Enron s previous CFO  Andrew Fastow  was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow s role in a partnership called LJM  which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron  As details of this deal and two others emerged  Enron stock cratered   The turmoil that resulted in Fastow s departure began two weeks ago  when Enron reported third quarter earnings that met estimates  However  the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a  1 2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions  Since then  investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities  Enron stock sank 6  Friday  meaning it has lost 56  of its value in just two weeks  Enron s End Run     New financial chief s involvement in Enron

about McMahon s participation in related entities  nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3   Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars related names by the related party companies   It s not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does  So far  subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date  January 1999   Among ES Power 3 s senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay  listed as a director  and McMahon and Fastow  listed as executive vice presidents  A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors  including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan  chairman of the Hong Kong based Hang Lung Group  A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn t commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn t immediately returned   Demands  Demands Rating agencies Moody s  Fitch and S P recently put Enron s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the  1 2 billion hit to equity  Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade  But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade  or junk  bonds  suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely   If Enron s rating drops below investment grade  it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least  3 4 billion in off balance sheet obligations  In addition  many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade   Friday  the company drew down  3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations  Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron s condition   This week  a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron  However  in a Friday press release  CEO Lay said that Enron was the  market maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets   He added   It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets    McMahon reportedly objected to Fastow s role in LJM  allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests  But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he s connected to don t do the same  Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was

flickering  To date  investors aren t sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re energizing the company he once built to greatness   What s happened at the Houston energy giant turned dwarf could ve been imagined with any number of ne er do well companies during the well chronicled bubble  But this is Enron  As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said   I never had to worry about Enron s ability to survive until this week  I still find it hard to believe    Peter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron s adventures for some time  If you d listened to him earlier this year  you d have profited from his knowledge  His reporting on Enron s partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding   The rumors    from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation    are  for now  just that  And  Enron did not single handedly cause the California power crisis  nor is Royal Dutch Shell  RD NYSE   news   commentary  about to make a bid to buy the company  Sources do tell me that head count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business  And  while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess  his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron s current woes   Now  Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and  more importantly  its reputation   The Company s Challenge But what does Enron do now  It s very simple  Come clean  clean up the mess and refocus on its core business  wholesale energy markets  risk management and retail energy services  They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks    Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off  and long term investors should hold firm  as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings  with upside potential to  25 per share over the next 12 18 months   says Jeff Dietert  power analyst at Simmons   Co  and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable   We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery    Dietert outlines four challenges for Enron  One  management must regain the Street s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow  Two  Enron must maintain its investment grade credit rating  Three  Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans  Four  Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book   Straightforward  Yes  Easy to accomplish  No   Although Enron says additional write downs are unlikely    except a  200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change    analysts aren t so sure  They re focused on the company s Global Assets portfolio  sporting  6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT  earnings before interest and taxes  loss of  18 million over the past 12 months   The divestitures include  390 million in exploration and production assets in India   250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and  250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General  which is set to close in 2002  There will likely be others  However  Enron has to execute here  and given the current state of its affairs  the seller will feel the pressure   The credit rating issue is a fine line  The current ratings  BBB  from Standard   Poor s and Baa1 from Moody s  are three levels above non investment grade  However  both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades  Dietert estimates that Enron s debt to market cap will be about 48  by year end  and the company has interest coverage  EBITDA  interest expense  of about 3 5 times  By comparison  the average S P BBB rated company has a debt to cap of 47 4  and interest coverage of about 6 1 times  The average BB company has debt to cap of 61 3  and interest expense of 3 8 times   Frankly  everything falls on Enron s management team and its ability to reassure investors   If Enron s management does not step up to calm investor fears  these fears could become a self fulfilling prophecy   Dietert says   In the potentially vicious cycle  investor fears could drive stocks down  the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades  potentially lower credit ratings force counter parties to reduce exposure to Enron  limiting Enron s ability to generate earnings and cash flow    It s time for Enron to grow up  Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk  I think it will  Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy  It s a tough call that requires strict  individual discipline   There s an irony to this whole story  especially in Enron s lack of candor in reporting its financial results  In a much lauded advertising campaign  Enron  looking to challenge conventional wisdom  asks the simple question   Why  Ask why    Investors are now asking  It s time for Ken Lay to answer   First Things First Many readers have asked about my relative quietness this week  Thank you for your concern  My father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade   The choice was easy  I m with him and my family   Enjoy your weekend with family and friends      DJ Enron Unit New England Market Downplay Report Of Default 2001 10 26 17 14  New York      By Kristen McNamara     Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES      NEW YORK  Dow Jones   Enron Corp  s  ENE  retail sales unit defaulted on its credit requirement in New England s wholesale power market this month  but the event was neither unique nor newsworthy  the energy company and the organization that developed the market s rules said Friday      The operator of the region s wholesale power market informed Enron Energy Services last week that  for the third time in 12 months  it had traded a greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at risk for expulsion from New England s market      But it was administrative mixups  rather than financial problems  that triggered the warning  which a few other companies have also received in the past  the market s rulemaker said       I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other participants  that have defaulted on their credit agreements   and it s never been in the news   said David Doot  secretary and general counsel for the New England Power Pool  which developed the policies governing the region s electricity market   My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of proportion       News of the Enron unit s default appeared in a trade publication and a major metropolitan newspaper this week  as Enron s dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company s stock and bond prices      Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its bonding requirement twice before  because both times it corrected the problem within a day  spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said      The letter sent by ISO New England  which operates the region s power market  to notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong person  delaying the company s response  Mahoney said       Clearly  it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit   Mahoney said      The company resolved the problem by Oct  19  Mahoney said  ISO New England spokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its default      It s rare for a company to default three times  but it has happened on occasion  Foley and Doot said       I won t say it s commonplace  but I won t say it s unusual for a participant to find itself out of compliance   Doot said   Those things have in fact happened from time to time        By Kristen McNamara  Dow Jones

Oct  26  Bloomberg     Enron Corp  s lawsuit alleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services could temporarily block the largest software company s high speed Internet service in some U S  regions        Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company from providing the high speed service in areas where Enron provides broadband access  leaving MSN fully operational only in the 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc  operates  said Bob Visse  director of marketing for MSN        Enron s lawsuit was filed yesterday  Microsoft had planned to offer fast Internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to give the largest software company access to potential customers in 29 million homes  Microsoft  the No  2 U S  Internet provider  is making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner Inc          We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron as quickly as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other providers    Visse said        Officials at Houston based Enron  the largest energy trader  did not immediately return calls for comment                            The Agreement       Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide bandwidth for MSN Internet service  Under the agreement  Enron isn t required to deliver operational broadband services if Microsoft hasn t first provided a billing and ordering system  Dow Jones newswire reported        Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of the deal  Dow reported        Enron s lawsuit comes after Microsoft said in an Oct  23 letter that Enron will have breached the contract if it hasn t provided an operational bandwidth system by Oct  25  allowing Microsoft to

a shareholder suing Enron Corp  are asking executives of the largest energy trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement with affiliated companies that bought and sold Enron assets        Lawyers have made the requests to President Greg Whalley  Vice Chairman Mark Frevert and Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon and 83 other employees arrived at Enron s Houston offices this week  said Paul Paradis  a partner in the New York law firm Abbey Gardy  Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such as Whitewing Management and Marlin Water        Paradis represents Fred Greenberg  an Enron shareholder who is suing the company s board for allowing former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at least  35 million in cash and  1 2 billion in lost shareholder equity        The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of partnerships that bought and sold company assets  Enron formed at least 18 such affiliated companies  listing executives and employees as officers and directors of the partnerships  according to Texas secretary of state records        Under Texas law  failure to respond to the document requests will result in subpoenas being issued  Subpoenas could go out next week if responses don t arrive by then  Paradis said  Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn t respond to requests for comment about the document requests        The executives earned no income from the partnerships  Enron spokesman Mark Palmer has said    There are no financial interests in the structures themselves for any Enron employee    Palmer said  He said it s common for a company to name its executives to the boards of affiliates                          Affiliates Have Debts       Texas records show Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay  Frevert  Whalley  McMahon and dozens of other people who list their address as Enron s corporate headquarters serving as officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign business corporations        The document requests ask Enron executives for information on any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the affiliates  including stock grants and options  They also ask the executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the affiliates        Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets such as power plants and natural gas pipelines  That allowed Enron to move debt associated with those projects off its books        The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money  They plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets  Enron might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and the debt  That could amount to at least

securities regulators into partnerships run by the former chief financial officer  remains a target of investigations and lawsuits in California        California lawmakers and regulators have accused power providers of manipulating the state s energy market to raise prices  Enron  the biggest energy trader  and other power sellers have denied the charges repeatedly        Next month  a California Senate committee investigating the power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading documents  Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento  California          They are still putting documents in their depository  and I don t think they ve completed that process    said Alexandra Montgomery  a consultant to the committee  It   remains to be seen   whether Enron is complying with its subpoena  she said        The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in California soared  leaving the state s two largest utilities insolvent  Under California s plan to open its electricity market to competition  the utilities of PG E Corp  and Edison International weren t allowed to pass rising costs to customers          I know that we re doing our best to comply with what the committee is asking for    Enron spokesman Mark Palmer    We are putting documents in the depository  and we re looking forward to a speedy resolution          Shares of Houston based Enron have fallen by more than half since Oct  16  The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief financial officer Wednesday amid a U S  Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron  35 million                               Grand Jury       Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for civil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer  who convened a grand jury in June        Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling the Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay in   an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says  Hi my name is Spike  honey      Lockyer later apologized for the remark        The attorney general s investigation is proceeding  Lockyer spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said  Michioku said she didn t know when civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power providers might be filed          Our investigation is still being pursued    she said    We had to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents  so that slowed things down a bit          Enron s Palmer said he didn t know the status of the attorney general s investigation          I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman    Palmer said                              More Lawsuits       Enron  along with other major power providers such as Duke Energy Corp  and Dynegy Inc   face at least five lawsuits alleging they manipulated California energy prices in violation of antitrust laws        The cases  which include separate complaints filed by the City of San Francisco  California Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante and various consumers  currently are in state courts awaiting a coordination proceeding  said Michael Aguirre  a lawyer representing Bustamante  The lawsuits should be assigned to a judge by the end of next month  he said        If the complaints succeed  the companies might be ordered to repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines

mature in 2009  declined 1 1 2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents  At that price  the bonds  which carry a rating of   BBB     yield 9 53 percent        Investors have grown concerned that the company s credit rating will be cut after  1 01 billion in third quarter losses from failed investments  Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions        Enron s decision to tap its credit line was   a smart financial move    said Stephen Moore  a vice president at Moody s Investors Service who follows the company    It took away the hassle and time consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital          Though Enron s bonds have investment grade ratings  their yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds that carry junk ratings  According to Bloomberg data  companies with   BB   ratings pay on average 9 16 percent to borrow for seven years        A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back holdings in other partnerships with its stock  diluting the value of Enron investors  stock        Partnerships called Whitewing  Marlin and Yosemite own Enron assets they bought with borrowed money  Enron sold the assets to the partnerships to keep related debt off its books  The partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the assets                            Other Liabilities       If Enron loses investment grade rating  the borrowed money comes due earlier  leaving less time for the partnerships to find the best price for the power plants and other assets  Enron would have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell for and the amount of the debt        One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships  That would thin out the holdings of every other investor        Of the two main bond rating companies  Moody s and Fitch have Enron on watch for possible downgrade  and Standard   Poor s lowered Enron s long term credit outlook to negative  Egan Jones Rating Co  today lowered its rating on

ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost the company  35 million in direct losses  Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the partnership  reducing shareholder equity by  1 2 billion          It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was

Employees  10 26 2001 Business Wire  Copyright  c  2001  Business Wire   SEATTLE   BUSINESS WIRE   Oct  26  2001  Seattle s Keller Rohrback L L P  is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron s retirement and 401 k  plans   The investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001  The investigation focuses on concerns that  under the law interpreting ERISA  Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment  Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans  participants  it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information  thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans  This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events  On Oct  16  2001  Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking  non recurring charges totaling  1 01 billion after tax  or   1 11  loss per diluted share   in the third quarter of 2001  Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships  controlled by Enron s CFO  and that the Company would be eliminating more than  1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments  As this news began to be assimilated by the market  the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly  In addition  several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading  gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds  Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement

Bonneville Power Administration  BPA  reached an ag  reement on a five year power delivery deal that has been the source of conf  lict between the two parties for almost a year  Kaiser Aluminum closed its   smelting operations in the Pacific Northwest in late 2000  choosing to rese  ll contracted power from the BPA on the spot market  According to the Spoke  sman Review   Kaiser netted more than  460 million from the sales   Other a  luminum companies reselling power from BPA reached agreements during spring   2001 with Bonneville  Under these agreements  the companies agreed to keep   smelters off line to keep power supplies ample in the region  and BPA agre  ed  in return  to give the smelters  when they restarted operations  a  20   per megawatt hour  MWh  credit for obtaining power from sources other than   BPA  Months of wrangling produced a contract between Kaiser and the BPA tha  t negates a  take or pay  clause that would require Kaiser to pay for the f  ederal power whether used or not  BPA said   Under the agreement signed tod  ay  Kaiser will avoid the possibility of paying damages if it does not take   all the power under the contract   And if  BPA  can t resell it  we are no  t going to hold  Kaiser  liable for the difference   Clearing Up reported    As a concession for the elimination of the  take or pay  clause  Kaiser wil  l receive interruptible service from the BPA on some of its 240 MW load  Ka  iser received criticism from union groups who claimed that the company was   using the money it had gained reselling power  to pay down long term debt    rebuild a refinery in Louisiana and reward executives with excessive bonuse  s   rather than splitting the money between workers that had been laid off    the BPA  and building generation  AP

CEO  IB  The California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority named La  ura Doll its new chief executive officer on 5 October  Texan Doll  had prev  iously worked for several communications and consulting firms   and will be   receiving a salary of  200 000 as the power authority s CEO  according to   the San Francisco Chronicle  S  David Freeman  the authority s chair  will   retain his post  Freeman said he will  handle fewer administrative duties     and will  be able to devote more time to reaching out to interest groups s  uch as the Legislature and consumer groups   The Chronicle reported  Accord  ing to a 7 October report in the Orange County Register  consumer groups  b  usinesses  and the legislature have questioned the recent actions of the po  wer authority  which has vowed to secure nearly 3 000 megawatts  MW  of pow  er by summer 2002 to avoid power shortages  The power authority  which was   created by Governor Gray Davis and the state Legislature in May 2001  can i  ssue up to  5 billion in bonds to bolster the state s power supply through   financing new renewable generation or peaker projects  The Register said th  at businesses and consumer groups are worried that higher electricity rates   could be the result of the power authority initiative to bring 1 000 MW of   green power and 2 000 MW of peaker generation on line by summer 2002  The   state s Joint Legislative Audit Committee would look into the authority s p  lanned purchases  according to the committee chair  Assembly member Fred Ke  eley  Keeley said  it s appropriate early and often to review their work in   a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law     the Register reported  More     https   www2 enronforum com content

sales that exceeded a federally   mandated price limit  Dynegy Corp   Mirant Corp   Williams Cos   and Relia  nt Energy were the companies specifically mentioned  Under a 19 June FERC o  rder  price limits were established in 11 Western states to help tame the v  olatile electricity spot market  The June order stated that companies charg  ing in excess of the mitigated price had seven days past the end of the mon  th in question to file justifications for their overcharges  The 5 October   order said that the aforementioned companies filed justifications  but all   were rejected  and that other companies that overcharged during July  but d  id not file justifications  would also be subject to ordered refunds  Altho  ugh FERC did not release specific figures  the California Independent Syste  m Operator said that total overcharges for the month amounted to  260 000    The Los Angeles Times reported  The commission s order explained the reject  ion of cost justifications for the four companies  The explanations by Mira  nt and Dynegy  filed more than seven days after July ended  were  untimely   and   neither company supported in detail its actual costs for its transact  ions   according to the document  Reliant s filing was  not consistent with   the requirements of the June 19 Order   and Willams  did not provide any c  ost support for its transactions beyond restating general objections to the   commission s pricing methodology   the commissioners wrote  A Mirant spoke  sman told Reuters that  his company was ordered to refund  33 800   while a   Williams spokesman told the LA Times   30 000 worth of electricity sales a  re subject to the FERC rebate for both June and July   More     https   www  2 enronforum com content content id 3D115981303  20   20     http
